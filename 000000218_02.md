  KINDRED MINDS.


At somewhere about the same time when
what has been related in the last chapter
was taking place between Olivier and the
Sphinx, Claire de Beauvoisin was seated in a
small room on the second floor of her hotel,
her hands crossed over a book that lay open
on her knees. The room was simply furnished,
hung with chintz (a pale grey ground covered
with clusters of field flowers), but there was
not a trace of luxury in it. It was lighted by
one lamp on a table near the window, the rest
of it being in deep shade. Near this table sat
the young Marquise, alone, and with the air of
a person who is watching. The third quarter  
  
  
  VOL. II. B
<!-- Leaf 12, Page: 2 -->
after nine had just struck, and was repeated
from the several church clocks in the
neighbourhood. When a long note, sounded by the
house-porter upon the timbre, reached Madame
de Beauvoisin's ears, she was not certain that,
instead of announcing a visitor, it was not
merely the third stroke of the last quarter of
the hour. For what visitor Avas likely to
come? and at all events none would disturb
her, for she had given orders to close the
doors, and say she did not receive. But it
was a visitor nevertheless, for a footstep was
audible upon the small staircase leading to this
room, and a footman presented himself at the
door, saying,—


\"Madame la Marquise, it is Monsieur le
Vicomte de Lancour, who "


\"It's only I, Claire," added a man's voice,
and passing quickly before the servant, Victor
advanced into the room, and, holding out his
hands to his cousin, added, " I have a message
from Olivier; of course you wouldn't refuse to
let me in—besides, I won't keep you a moment."
<!-- Leaf 13, Page: 3 -->

Claire had started up at the sight of her
cousin Victor, and had come forward a few
steps, but without extending a hand to the
unexpected visitor. She looked embarrassed and
not pleased. The footman left the room and
closed the door.


\"Olivier is detained," began M. de Lancour;
\"it is not his fault if you are told so late, it is
not my fault either—it is an accident; but
Olivier can't possibly "go with you to the ball;
he thinks you had better go with his mother or
your mother."


\"I am not going to the ball," replied Claire;
\"and, pray don't speak so loud; Pierre is
there," and she pointed with her hand to the
dark part of the room, where stood a cradle
hung with clear muslin curtains.


"You don't mean to say the child's ill,"
rejoined her cousin, with genuine and tender
anxiety.


\"I was seriously afraid he was so a few
hours ago; but he is better now, and sleeping
quite calmly. I had forgotten all about the ball."  
  
  
  B 2
<!-- Leaf 14, Page: 4 -->

"Well, Bouffemont would be ill-pleased if
he heard that," said Victor, with a smile; " he
fancies this house-warming ball of his is an
object of European interest. There is not a
cocodette of the great world who will not be
there, and they say Madame de Varignan's
dress is to cost thirty thousand francs ! "


\"What message was it you brought ? "
inquired Claire, re-seating herself, and pointing
to a chair, Avhich her cousin appropriated to
himself.


\"Simply this: Olivier had intended to be
back in Paris in time to take you to the ball at
Bouffemont's. He found (just before dinner,
I suppose, for his telegram is dated half-past
six) that this was not possible; and then
telegraphed off to me to tell me to put myself
at your service, and advise you to go either
with the DoAvager or Avith Madame de
Clavreuil. I didn't dine at home. The telegram
was brought by my servant to the club, and I
only got it twenty minutes ago, and came off to
you instantly. You see it was nobody's fault."
<!-- Leaf 15, Page: 5 -->

\"Olivier was out of town, then ? " observed
Claire.


\"Olivier is at St. Germain, at the great fete
given by his uncle "  
  
  
  " By M. de Moranges ? "


\"Yes; Olivier has become quite a favourite
with his uncle."


Madame de Beauvoisin looked at her cousin
Victor Avith a strange expression of something
verging on contempt. "I did not know," said
she, " that Olivier was an habitue there."


\"Perhaps I have done wrong, then, to tell
you," rejoined M. de Lancour; " but I thought
you knew it. You must not forget that you
yourself are on very good terms with your
uncle Moranges."


\"I meet my uncle Moranges abroad," said
Claire, " chiefly at aunt Clementine's, and I do
like talking Avith him extremely; he is so much
more agreeable and better informed than the
younger men of our world. But with my uncle
in his own home I have nothing to do, and I
do think that they who go there do wrong."
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 6 -->

\"One must not be over hard," said Victor,
turning a paper-knife round and round in his
fingers; " one never ought to judge—one never
knows all."


\"I hope I never am hard upon any one,"
responded Claire; " I try not to be so."


Perhaps she had given to her words more
expression than she intended, for M. de
Lancour seemed in no hurry to break the silence
that folloAved them. At last:  
  
  
  " When did your boy fall ill ? " asked he.


\"In the middle of the day. I was just going
out to drive, when, as usual, I ran up to see
him before going out, and found him hot and
uneasy, and with a sudden cough that alarmed
me. I sent for the doctor, and for aunt
Clementine; and for three or four hours he Avas
very restless. But it seems it was nothing but
the cutting of a tooth. The potion they gave
him calmed him, and since the last two hours
he has been quite quiet. Aunt Clementine
dined with me up here beside his cradle, and
only left me at nine o'clock."
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 7 -->

\"May one look at Pierre ?" asked Victor,
breaking the silence that had established itself
between the two.


\"If you do so very quietly, so as not to
wake him. Stay! I will give you a light,"
and rising, she lighted a taper in a flat
candlestick, and accompanied her cousin to the
child's bed. Victor raised the curtain with
the touch of a practised nurse, and bent over
the cradle, while Claire shaded the light with
her hand.


The baby was sleeping soundly, with evident
moisture upon his rosy skin, and on one cheek
just a tiny flush remaining of Avhat had marked
the passage of his few hours' fever.


\"Dear little fellow," murmured Victor, in
just that tone of genuine fondness which—
whatever be the other feelings in the mother's
heart—will not leave her unsympathetic. And
then he looked scrutinisingly at the sleeping
child, touched his forehead cautiously, saw
there was no fever left, and as he turned away,
said again, " Dear little fellow! " and returned
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 8 -->
to his seat opposite to the Marquise, having
first bid her put aside the curtains that were
round the cradle.


\"But they say he should be kept warm,"
objected she, obeying all the same.


Victor smiled. "Nonsense!" said he;
\"that is the worn-out science of stupid,
Avornout doctors; a child should have air."


\"How can you possibly know anything
about children?" inquired the youngMarquise.


\"Because I have been twelve years a
soldier," replied he; " and he must be a sorry
soldier who in that time has not learned Iioav
to take care of his own species, Avhether men,
women, or children. I limit my doctor's skill,
you see, at this moment to human beings, but
an officer who should not be a veterinary
surgeon Avould have learnt only half his trade; if a
man does not learn an immense deal in the army,
he runs the risk of forgetting nearly everything.
Most men do learn, luckily."  
  
  
  Claire shook her head. " That is not what
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 9 -->
people generally say in our world," observed
she.


\"Claire," said Victor, at a later period of
this conversation, " listen to me once, Ave do
not meet often noAv. Do you think I cannot
trace your mother's hand, and above all, the
hand of that execrable mother of Olivier's, in
your altered manner to me ? Do you think I
don't know what they have been saying to
you ? Do you think I don't see the difference
in you, Claire? Do you think you have not
hurt me more than any other living creature
upon earth could have hurt me?"


There was a tender reproachfulness in
Victor's tone as he thus spoke that stirred Claire's
heart, and made her turn pale, while tears
gathered under her drooping eyelids.


\"That saintly aunt Clementine, too," he
pursued; " do you think "


\"Stop," interrupted Claire; " you do her
injustice. Aunt Clementine has altogether
another creed. I believe she thinks that
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 10 -->
everything may be forgiven where there is a real
attachment; " her voice was very low, and she
spoke with hesitation.


\"So much the better for her. But then, in
God's name, Claire, my o-wn Claire, why did
she alloAv them to marry you to Olivier?"
The words burst from him involuntarily.


Claire, pale as death, looked at him,
speechlessly, but looked at him full in the face, stared
at him vacantly with her large, hopeless eyes.


\"Forgive me, dear child," said he, gently.
\"I have let myself be carried away by my
extreme affection for you " (the Marquise had in
one second recovered all her self-possession);
\"we were brought up together, dear, though I
was ten or eleven years older than you; you
Avere my little sister—you were a child whom
I could still take on my knee Avhen I left St.
Cyr (and how you admired my uniform that
day!); you greAv gradually into the sweet,
lovely, darling girl you were last year, while I
was battling through life in God knows what
out-of-the-way places; every time I came back
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 11 -->
you were more charming, lovelier, dearer, and
so glad, so happy to see me, Claire! and then,
one fine day, when I returned home from
Algeria, I find you gone—gone to Italy with
your husband—married to Olivier de
Beauvoisin."


\"You will, I presume, scarcely deem it a
proof of friendship to speak ill of my husband
tome?" remarked the Marquise.


{empty}M. de Lancour rose, took a few steps
forwards, and then backwards, and standing in
front of his cousin, " Claire," said he, sadly, " it
is evident that you have been taught to think
so ill of me that you cannot understand me
any more. I will not importune you longer,
but I have said too much not to say more.
When I lost you, Claire, I lost the sweetest,
best thing a man can have in life—a true and
loving sister. That ought not to have been.
The man you should have married, ought
to have been my brother for the love I bore
you, and to you, my married sister, Claire,
I ought to have been able to come and
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 12 -->
confide all that is painful and irretrievable in
my existence; but the eternal system was
practised Avith you as with all others. A man,
—no, a fortune, a name, an estate, Avas fixed
upon, and your establishment Avas planned
out and achieved; you never dreamt of
resistance, no one ever dreamt of rescuing you; the
same thing had been done for centuries and
submitted to by everybody whom everybody
else ever knew, and therefore why should you
be an exception. Had I been here, Claire, I
Avould have appealed to you, and prevented
the sacrifice, for you were better worth than
that, my poor, dear cousin—at all events, better
worth then."


"Worth very little now, do you mean to
imply ?" demanded the Marquise, but more
in sadness than in anger.


\"No, Claire, dear," rejoined Victor, " I do
not mean anything of the sort, and I will prove
it to you. I am not in pain for what the Avorld,
unworthy as it is to judge, will call your Avorth.
I am in pain for your happiness. Marriage as
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 13 -->
we practice it in this country leads to misery,
for if sin be avoided the entire nature is
narroAved down; all human beings to be Avorth
anything must love, and therefore, my own
dear cousin Claire, do your best to love your
husband!"  
  
  
  "I do so," rejoined she, defiantly.


\"No, Claire, you do not, for he is morally a
stranger to you, as you are to him. It won't
do, dear child, there is misery in it. Bring up
that boy there," and he pointed to the child's
cradle, "to do the very reverse of all that
his forefathers have done; teach him to love
ardently, deeply, but to be bound where he
has loved, to love purely; teach him that
there is no dignity, and no happiness out of a
married life based on love; and Claire, my
dear little sister, Claire, force yourself to love
your husband, devote yourself to the study of
him, know him, find out his better points,
educate, fashion, transform him; there is
something in everyone, bring out that
something in Olivier."
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 14 -->

"There is nothing!" muttered Claire, as
though speaking to herself.  
  
  
  Their eyes met, and both looked blank.


\"And you told me you loved him! "
exclaimed Victor mournfully.


They did not speak long together after that,
but when he was gone Claire Avent to her
child's cradle, knelt down by it, and hiding
her face in the coverings, prayed and Avept.
Every word of Victor's was the reflection of
Avhat she felt in her own heart, and what it
seemed now too late to feel, and the lessons
he tried to teach her Avere no longer applicable,
for the one, only one for whom she Avould have
risked and sacrificed everything, was devoted
to another Avoman, and imploring her to do
her utmost to love another man. " It Avas so
hard? " thought Claire.
<!-- Leaf 25 -->
  
  CHAPTER II.  
  
  
  IN FOR IT.


A week had passed since the fete given by
{empty}M. de Moranges at St. Germain.


It was early in the day, and Olivier was in
his stable, (the stable he looked down into
from the plate glass over the chimney piece in
his room). He was walking up and down, with
the eternal cigar in his mouth; by his side
walked Count Dupont de la Porte : the stable
was for the moment empty, and the two men
were speaking low.


\"So that you suppose the Dowager actually
never knew anything at all about it ?" said
Henri Dupont, continuing a conversation
already begun before.


\"I don't believe she ever guessed at a single
incident; but then, you know, the Abbe
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 16 -->
Lannion was such a screen ! his fright was
something ludicrous, because he never could, to the
last, understand the matter as it really
happened, nor conceive hoAv his proselytising, and
above all, his political zeal, could have got me
into such a scrape; he thinks to this hour he
did his duty in trying to convert Mardonnet;
Avhat's more, he is convinced he did convert
him, and he would act over again just as he
acted before, if all Avere to recommence; but
it was marvellous to see Iioav for tAvo years he
always managed to get money Avhenever it was
required."


\"What! so the abbe furnished the means
of stopping Mardonnet's mouth till you were of

age?"


\"Naturally. I was but nineteen; there were
two years to run, so six or seven times we had
to furnish instalments to Mardonnet."


\"Well, I wonder the fellow didn't try to
frighten your mother," propounded Dupont,
stopping short in his lounge.  
  
  
  " No one would attempt that," rejoined
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 17 -->
Olivier. "Bless you, she's as well known as
the Avhite wolf; not only doAvn in our country,
but even here in Paris. You just go and ask
anybody connected with affairs, or with the
Bourse, any Jew, or any broker, about the
Dowager Marquise de Beauvoisin, and see
what they'll say. Frighten her % No one ever
did that; besides, what stopped Mardonnet
was, that he knew if she was applied to, he
would lose his money."


\"Hoav do you mean that, Olivier ? "
exclaimed Henri. " You don't imagine, do you,
that your mother would have refused to repay
what you really had borrowed 1"


\"My mother refuse ! " echoed the Marquis;
\"of course she would. I was a minor, and
she could not only have refused, but have
prosecuted Mardonnet for conspiracy, and I don't
know what besides."


\"But the disgrace to your name ? "
interrupted Dupont; " the shame, the scandal ? she
would have recoiled before all that ?"  
  
  
  " Not she," affirmed her son; " andMarVOL. II.  
  
  
  C
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 18 -->
donnet well knew that, and left her in peace.
Refuse, indeed," he continued, " I should think
she Avould have refused; and quite right
too."


\"Right, Olivier 1" said Count Dupont, in a
severe tone, and looking his companion full in
the face. " Right! Avhy, then, if that's your
creed, didn't you imitate her example ? Why
didn't you refuse to pay ? or Avhy didn't you
tell her yourself, and make her help you out of
the scrape ?"


Olivier evaded his friend's gaze, turned pale,
and then scarlet, took his cigar from his lips,
then put it back and dreAV a tremendous puff,
then coughed from haAdng half strangled
himself. At last—


\"You take one's words so literally,"
stammered he, still coughing, and looking the very
picture of embarrassment. " Of course, if I
had really meant to be dishonest I could have
been so easily : but, you see, I paid in the end.
I only say what my mother would have done;
—my mother's a tough one. But you do catch
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 19 -->
one up so, Henri; one says things one don't
mean."


\"It's a bad practice, Olivier," replied
Dupont; " and there are things that ought never
to be uttered even in joke."  
  
  
  They lounged on a few paces in silence.


\"And so," resumed Count Dupont, " the
abbe provided you Avith funds for two whole

n it
years {


\"Yes : it didn't come to so very much after
all. Twelve thousand francs about. But,
Lord ! he got it for the asking; old ladies gave
it him, and thought they were buying eternal
salvation by chapel building. He could get
any sum in a given time."  
  
  
  " And I presume you repaid him ?'


\"I should think so : he took me ten per
cent, interest, which he swore was for the

poor.


\"And what made Mardonnet marry Camille
Leblond \ " inquired Henri.


"Why, her money, to be sure," replied
OliAder; " she has been a mdch cow to him.  
  
  
  c 2
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 20 -->
She brought him no inconsiderable sum at
once; and she got him the appointment of
cashier to that bank that Avas founded
somewhere in Moldavia or Wallachia, and where
they went two or three years ago to live.
Besides, to say the truth, I believe Mardonnet
was in love Avith her."


And the Marquis indulged in a laugh that
prevented him from seeing the expression of
disgust upon his friend's countenance.  
  
  
  " Were you ?" asked Dupont.  
  
  
  "Not I," Avas the rejoinder.


\"Then all that money was spent, and all
that scrape got into without any
sentimentality \ " remarked Henri. " It was insanity
with premeditation, was it ?"


\"Well, you see, Roger and Gaston both ran
after the girl; and Gaston was rich, and could
spend a good deal, and, of course, I couldn't be
outdone by him;—and Camille was immensely
the fashion."  
  
  
  " So we note down then: item—no love,"

said Dupont.
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 21 -->

\"Well," retorted Olivier, " I don't think I'm
exactly the sort of man to go falling in love;"
and he appeared to feel a proud satisfaction at
being able to make this statement.


"We say: item,no love," pursued Henri. "Tell
me frankly, OliAder, Avas there any amusement ?"


\"I should say none in particular," Avas the
ansAver; " on the whole, rather a bore,—as
those kind of things always are."


\"And yet it cost tolerably dear," resumed
Count Dupont. " Well, my good felloAv, I
never knew the rights of the story before, and
I used to regret that I had been absent when
it all happened; but now I see I shouldn't
have been of much use to you."


He Avent his way, and Olivier mounted the
stairs leading to his splendid blue and sdver
furnished room.


He had scarcely been in it more than a few
minutes, when his OAvn confidential valet
entered, and informed him that a lady was in
{empty}M. le Marquis's ante-room, and requested to
see him upon most urgent business.
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 22 -->

\"It is the second time she has been here
this morning," said the man; " she came about
an hour ago, when M. le Marquis had just gone
down into the stable with M. le Comte Dupont,
so she Avent away, and said she would come

again.  
  
  
  " Is she young or old ?" asked Olivier.


\"It is hard to say, M. le Marquis," replied
the valet, " she is so very thickly veiled; but
from the voice I should say young, and from
her dress it is easy to see that she is a great
lady—the richest of everything she has on ! "


"Well, Leroux, I suppose she must be let
in," said M. de Beauvoisin, in a sort of
halfvictimised tone, and rubbing the back of his
head Avith an air of great perplexity. " I hope
there's no family complication impending
anywhere," he muttered, as his servant left the

room.


The rustle of silk was heard Avinding up the
staircase, a luscious, spicy perfume invaded the
room, as through the open door stepped the
form of a veiled Avoman. M. de Beauvoisin
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 23 -->
bowed, as the door was closed, and pointed to
a seat, saying, very politely,—


\"Madame, may I ask to what I owe the
honour "


But as the lady advanced towards him, and
still standing, took off her veil, the words died
upon his tongue. He started and turned pale
Avith unmistakeable alarm.


\"You, Claudine ! " he exclaimed; " you
here ! What can have made you commit such
an act of madness ?"


\"You ! " she replied, coming closer to him,
and laying her hand upon his arm. " Why
have you never come since the other day ?
You said you would come the next day, and I
Avaited at home till evening—I said I was not
Avell, and could not go out driAdng—but you
never came; it was a week yesterday."


\"But I have been," faltered OliAier, " I have
been twice."


"Yes," she resumed, "at times when you
knew there would be no one in; you came the
day of the Matinee at the Pre Catelan, and on
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 24 -->
Sunday before the return from the races; you
kneAV I should be forced to go to both."


Claudine was much altered during this Aveek,
far more beautiful than before, but of quite a
different beauty. All the sleepy repose had
fled from her countenance, and the latent
beauty that Henri Dupont had foreseen in her
on that rainy night in the courtyard at
Clavreuil, had sprung to life Avith strange, nay,
terrible intensity. The lustrous eyes were full
of flame, and their lids no longer heavily
drooping over them, seemed draAvn upAvards
by the action of the hard, sharp, relentless
eyebroAv (the Medusa-like feature of the face, as
Henri Dupont had at once divined). Her lips,
no longer like Avet rubies, were dry and
unequally red; the smooth satin of her skin was
disturbed, and dark shadows lay upon it, and
the hand she had laid upon M. de Beauvoisin's
arm burned like an ember just snatched from
a furnace.


Olivier, it must be avowed, felt
uncomfortable and helpless, as he became, Avith one
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 25 -->
glance, aware of the sudden alteration in the
Sphinx. The woman no longer lay dormant
in Claudine. Was this anyone's fault; hers,
or his, or whose ? That was too much of an
enigma for Olivier's faculties; but the whole
affair, as he mentally styled it, Avas
unpleasant.


What was he to do ? Why, of course, get
Claudine to go away as fast as possible; but
how ? He scarcely knew what to say to her,
as she stood gazing at him with her terrible
eyes, and still holding his arm with her
burning fingers.


\"Tell me why you have never come ?" she
recommenced; " why did you break your
promise i


\"My dear creature," stammered Olivier, " I
must take care of—of your reputation; " and
Avhen she had released his arm, and was
looking him through and through, he first
perceived what a foolish speech, in his confusion,
he had made.  
  
  
  " My reputation ?" she repeated, in a tone
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 26 -->
of such bitterness that it frightened him.
\"What is that 1 Do not say things of that
kind to me, or I shall kill myself." (Olivier
shuddered.) " Concealment is our only policy,
and I will answer for nothing being found out,
if I am not driven mad by doubt of you." She
came nearer to him once more, and took his
hand in hers : " I will be as gentle and
obedient as a dog," murmured she, " so long as
you do not cease to love me; but if I fear to
lose you, I shall go mad. I have not slept
for a week, and, this morning, I resolved to
tell your uncle everything;" (Olivier was
stunned by this unexpected bloAV;) " but then
I thought it was best to try and see you first,
and so I came. I Avas desperate, for I had
not even the hope that you Avere ill! I heard
indirectly of your goings and comings at the
club."


\"Hoav did you contrive to get away alone?"
inquired Olivier, anxious to know Avhat Avas
the measure of imprudence committed.  
  
  
  " I said I was going to church to hear a
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 27 -->
mass for my mother," she ansAvered, naively.
"I do go sometimes, and then I go alone;
Aspasie only comes on Sundays and great feast
days."


\"Well, you must make haste back now,"
observed Olivier, " or Ave shall all be in danger
of detection : in ten minutes the breakfast-bell
Avill ring, and my mother breakfasts here
today. When she is in the house, I am neA'er
safe, for she might come up here."


\"I Avill go directly," responded Claudine,
\"and do Avhatever you bid me, so that I am sure
of you. But you will not stay away any more ?
You will come as you used to do, every day ?"


\"Yes, dear," was the rejoinder of the
vanquished lover.


All the menace and all the fierceness of
disappointed passion had expired in the whole
being of the Sphinx. She laid the scented
Avaves of her fair hair under Olivier's chin,
wound her arm about his neck, and spun her
Dejanira web around him naturally, and not
meaning any harm.
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 28 -->

Olivier's fate Avas sealed. Claire de
Clavreuil's husband, the man she had, unloving,
espoused, and Avho loved not her, Avas
imprisoned in the toils of a Traviata, to be
extricated therefrom as it might please blind
chance.


\"Olivier ?" Avhispered Claudine, as,
halfdisengaged from his embrace, she still clung
to him, with looks that seemed as though they
Avould never loose their hold; " tell me now,
Avhy you did not come?"


He hesitated, passed his hand over his
forehead, and then, looking at her, said,—


\"Because I felt you Avere an aAvful danger
for me, Claudine; and, hang it, so you are !"
he added, in a more decided tone.


\"But you Avon't try to escape from it any
more, will you \ " she murmured, nestling her
head once more into his neck.


\"Oh, no," rejoined he, with an accent she
did not understand; " it's no use trying now :
I'm in for it."  
  
  
  AVhat Olivier's reflections might have been
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 29 -->
  
  upon his present situation AAdien once Claudine
was safely gone, it Avould be difficult to tell;
they were cut short by the entrance of the
Dowager through the door communicating
with the rest of the hotel, who came to ask
him if he had not heard the breakfast-bell.
<!-- Leaf 40 -->
  
  CHAPTER III.  
  
  
  RISING WAVES.


The day had come when Claudine had
discovered that which was hitherto undreamt-of
in her philosophy; a fire had been suddenly
lighted, and had made Adsible many objects
unguessed at before. Many, but not all—for
Claudine's conscience was full of dark corners
and nooks, where no light had ever penetrated.
It was not as if you, for instance, had been
illumined by the flame of a forbidden passion;
you would, of course, have seen at one glance,
clearly, the whole mesh of your duties and
dangers, and would have immediately done your
duty and trampled sin under your heel. But
then you are born respectable and incapable of
wrong; you are Avarranted to go straight all
the days of your life, and not to make mistakes,
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 31 -->
and even should you, by any untoward
circumstance, swerve from the straight line, you,
being like the British soldier, who doesn't know
when he is beaten, will go on unheeding, and
esteem yourself victorious. But Claudine was
horribly in the dark, and groped about among
her instincts and her duties in a most
unsatisfactory fashion.


What might to you, or to any ordinarily
educated person, seem anomalous, presented
itself as compatible to the confused mind of
this girl. Her gratitude to M. de Moranges
was not in the slightest degree diminished
(that she would have regarded as a crime);
but she saw no reason why gratitude to him,
and a very different feeling for OliAder, should
not co-exist so long as concealment was
practised. As to most primitive natures,
concealment appeared to Claudine a virtue—a
kindness done to the deceived; and here is
one of the main points in which the educated
err when they judge the uneducated—namely,
those to whom no true knowledge of right
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 32 -->
and wrong, no genuine notion of integrity has
been given.


Claudine had, since the day of the fete at St.
Germain, sprung suddenly up to the topmost
pitch of what Avas destined to be her fame.
The Hungarian, to Avhom that fete had been
given, had spoken of her beauty in such
extravagant terms that the mass of men Avhose office
it is to be the collective Paris of such Helens—
the frequenters of clubs, coulisses, and
racecourses—had momentarily adjudged to her the
prize, and she Avas for a brief space a reigning

queen.


This mainly helped her in her work of
concealment, for Avhen any Avoman, in no matter
what sphere, becomes the fashion, it is hard
in the stir and rumour around her to fix upon
any one particular individual as favoured
beyond his compeers. Claudine had far more
her OAvn Avay than before, for M. de Moranges
Avas flattered in his proprietorship, and felt full
of grace and benignity towards the woman
AAdio, being openly his, Avas acknoAvledged as
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 33 -->
the best, the most complete of her kind. This
Avas right and proper on Claudine's part; there
was a fittingness in it Avhich pleased the
Marquis's exquisite taste, and he regarded her with
the same favour he extended to the horse, or
picture, or jewel, which might have cost him
dearest. He did not, as yet, know what was the
price he was destined to pay for this pleasure;
but he was charmingly condescending to
Claudine, and quite spoiled her, allowing her to obey
the dictates of her own will in almost
everything, excepting always the article of gaudy
attire, and just one other item, on which he was
gently, elusively inflexible. Claudine wanted
to be called Madame de Savaray. She had
found out that among the titles belonging to
the house of Moranges existed that of Baron
de Savaray, proceeding from a small estate
(scarcely more than a farm) still remaining in
the possession of the family, and for this
appellation she longed. It Avas a real thing! a
thousand times better than Ste. Amaranthe,
or St. Pierre, or St. Romain, or any other  
  
  
  VOL. II. D
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 34 -->
saint of the whole calendar applied to an
imaginary name. Madame de Savaray ! or even,
who knoAvs ? Madame la Baronne de Savaray !
for that Claudine hungered and thirsted, more
even than for the flaunting stuffs embroidered
in silver and gold, with which she was dying
to sweep the dusty footpath in the broad
avenue of the Champs Elysees. But neither of
these things could the Sphinx obtain. M. de
Moranges was as inexorable on the subject of
the name which was in the annals of his house,
and had been worn in days of yore by its maids
and matrons, as he was upon that of the
gorgeous wearing apparel; nor did he (luckily)
understand the insistance Avith which day after
day Claudine appeared to hanker after both.


Our friend Aspasie, too, found much to
employ and please her in the increasing
brilliancy of Madame Claudine's position. She
indulged in hopes and prospects of gain on all
sides, and being decidedly a combinative genius,
thought she saw her way to serving several
masters at once, and did not despair of large
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 35 -->
remuneration from the Dowager, from M. de
Moranges, and perhaps even from Olivier ! But
that was her secret.


' You had your usual luck, Moranges, when
you laid hands on that piece of feminine
intelligence ! " said M. de Sauveterre one day to his
friend, glancing across the salon at Aspasie,
whose back was turned towards the speakers.
\"She is invaluable! so amusing and ready
Avitted, yet so full of tact, and always in her
place ! truly a Avonderful person, and a first

rate manager, isn't she ?"


\"Yes! she is first rate," replied the Marquis,
with conviction, " and it is, as you observe, a
piece of undeniable luck ! But Paris is the
mother earth of that kind of female; she grows
nowhere else, but comes to perfection here."


\"Female ! female ? if you Avill," objected old
Sauveterre; "I said a piece of feminine
intelligence, I never said anything else, and that is
what she is, and that does grow here, and as
you say, comes to perfection; but Paris don't
grow women, my good friend; real, genuine  
  
  
  D 2
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 36 -->
women; look over there," and he pointed with
his finger to where, on the threshold of the
glass door opening into the garden, Claudine
stood surrounded by a group of men. " Look
at those outlines, Paris never grew that! ma
foi! but she has groAvn into a superb creature.
I could not have believed it possible such a
Avretched-looking half starved thing as she
seemed Well! that comes of being a
connoisseur in art, I suppose. But you certainly
made a glorious hit, old fellow !"


There had been a breakfast at the Hotel de
Moranges, and some fifteen or twenty men
were lounging about in the draAving-rooms or
in the garden or in the smoking-room. M. de
Moranges never smoked himself, and never
alloAved smoking in his house, except in the
room set aside for that purpose.


He was standing against the chimney piece
of the principal salon, Avhilst M. de Sauveterre
Avas seated close by, Avhen the colloquy above
repeated took place. Aspasie Avas busy Avith
coffee and liqueurs at a table at the other
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 37 -->
end of the room, and Claudine, as has been
stated, formed the centre of a group at the
windoAv.


The Marquis, as M. de Sauveterre's words
fell pleasantly on his ear, directed a long,
scrutinising look to Claudine; a look that
seemed to say : "If there be a flaw anywhere,
I Avill find it, and Avhen found, impartially pass
judgment on it." It was a hard, appraising
look; but when it was withdrawn, it was full
of satisfaction; of a quiet self-sufficing sort of
pride.


Some one asked Claudine to sing, and M.
de Moranges echoing the request, she Avent
towards the piano, and obediently opened it.
But with that act her obedience and passiAdty
ceased. When she began to sing she was
herself, her new and recent self, and if self-love
had not thickened the fine subtle perceptions
of M. de Moranges, he Avould surely have asked
himself whence came the impassioned tones to
which he listened? It was all so different;
the statue had once been so plainly there,
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 38 -->
where noAv breathed, blushed, and gloAved the
soft-fleshed, living woman.


But the Pygmalion ? where was he ? No
one asked himself this question; neither the
Marquis, nor that lynx-eyed Aspasie Mourjon
(women seldom recognise the testimony of that
infallible Avitness, the voice) ! But the effect
produced was great, and the applause won by
Claudine was enthusiastic.


The young gentleman Avho accompanied her,
a beardless aspirant to lyrical renoAvn, Avas
unfortunately a Avorshipper of classical music,
and swore by the true gods, from Palestrina
down to Wagner, and had the absurdity to beg
Claudine to sing something of Mozart's, Avhich
she did. Here she was at once second, or
indeed, third rate, singing a string of notes as
her master had taught her, and totally lacking
the superior intelligence required to give the
higher idea, to translate the musical sense.
This was a failure, and the weight of it fell
entirely on the shoulders of the youth who had
been so ill-adAdsed as to petition for a sample
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 39 -->
of the Old Masters. Decidedly, classical music
was a bore. Offenbach was better than that;
but best of all were the sentimental strains
in which the words are everything, and in
which the expression given to them proves the
value of the singer.


{empty}M. de Moranges was no connoisseur in music
(men of his stamp never are). But truth
compels always; and, as in the false art
Claudine practised, the passion was true, so
that passion compelled him, and he listened,
and was impressed, carried away, before he
avowed to himself his surprise.


When his guests were all gone the Marquis
approached Claudine, and spoke to her, and
praised her in a manner he was not used to
affect. She felt her favour, and with a
diffident air, and raising her eyes timidly, said she
wished she might speak frankly.


\"Speak Avith entire frankness," replied the
Marquis, Avith an accent she had not hitherto
heard (and apparently forgetting the dangers
connected Avith the Barony of Savaray). " I
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 40 -->
am not in the habit of intimidating you, I
hope ? " This was added with more than
condescension.


\"I should like to go on the stage," faltered
Claudine, hurriedly, and fluttering as it were
under the beat of her OAvn blushes. " Oh ! I
should so like it!" she added, joining her
hands, and looking more beautiful Avith each
instant.


{empty}M. de Moranges did not answer at first.
He was absorbed in his contemplation of
Claudine. At last, Avith an expression of
paternal fondness—fond, but paternal—" The
stage !" he repeated, smiling, and raising his
eyebroAvs Avith a sort of compassionate
surprise, " foolish child ! the stage ? that is hard
Avork for a pretty Avoman! it spoils the
complexion. No beauty stands it long."


Claudine knew her Avish Avas denied, and
shrank back into her old subserviency.


\"I only said I should like it," she rejoined,
crouchingly. " I hope you will not be angry."  
  
  
  " Certainly not," was the gracious answer;
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 41 -->
\"and to proAre it to you, I Avill take you this
evening to hear Theresa; she is an artist in
her way, and as you are getting to sing so
well, it is right you should hear every one,
Theresa, as well as La Nilsson—the tAvo
extremes."


It was so very rare a thing for the Marquis
to appear in any public place with Claudine,
that the full extent of his benignity seemed
appreciated by both ladies; our friend Aspasie
simply murmuring that she was rather taken
unawares by this honour, her spring toilettes
not being in thorough readiness, which resulted
in a munificent recommendation to proAride
herself for that evening with a mantelet of
Black Chantilly lace, (Black, not white!
black was so unobtrusive !)
<!-- Leaf 52 -->
  
  CHAPTER IV.  
  
  
  THE MEETING OF THE AVATERS.


The evening Avas a beautiful one, warm and
balmy, yet Avith just a light breeze stirring the
leaves of the trees, and floating the perfumes
of floAvers to mortal senses. The Champs
Elysees Avere full of busy life, carriages rolling
up and down the wide avenue, and loungers
on foot thronging the pavement and the spaces
betAveen the trees. The hum of the croAvd
rose no higher than the topmost boughs, and
then merged into the stillness of night; and
down upon the human ant-hill, with its
wouldbe importance, its agitation and its mock
finery, gazed the eternal stars—those self-same  
  
  
  stars that were at that self-same hourshiningover Nature's glories, mirroring their serene
light in streams and seas, piercing throuo-h
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 43 -->
forest depths, or letting their rays tremble on
the crests of lone lofty hills, chamois-haunted,
and even in summer snoAV swathed. The
selfsame stars!


Immutable ! yes, truly; whilst all beneath
them Avas composed of atoms for ever
changing; gone before you could chronicle their
being.


But in spite of their short-livedness and
their short-comings, these ephemeral creatures,
AAdiich furnish the aggregate sum of existence
in a great city, wherein it is possible there may
not be one really grand human soul, these
atoms are as interesting as the stars, for they
suffer. All have their passion, and we know
it, we who have passed through it in our time.


There they Avere, in crowds that evening,
round the illuminated platform where Theresa
was singing; there they were, all;—women
and men, the leaders of the great masquerade,
of the noisy, gaudy, ugly, barbarously
illdressed world of La Cocodetterie. Round
every table sat groups of twos, fours, and
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 44 -->
more. Round one table, full in the glare of
the lamps that lighted the temporary stage,
Avere drawn together some ten or a dozen
individuals Avorse-dressed and noisier than the
rest, and Avho might have been supposed to
belong to Avhat is styled the lowest set, had
there not been something excessive about them
Avhich betrayed affectation, the assumption of
an appearance not in accordance Avith the
reality.


In this party—some of Avhom are already
knoAvn to us—there Avere three or four Avomen,
painted, dyed, and hung about Avith ornaments
and clothes, much after the fashion in which
probably a Red Indian female Avould deck
herself out were she suddenly let loose among the
Avardrobe treasures of a Paris costume shop.
The fact Avhich chiefly bore Avitness to the
status of these ladies in Avhat is termed Society
was the Avay in which they had succeeded in
making themselves less good-looking than they
were, which is a fault rarely committed by the
professional, she Avhose success in
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 45 -->
beautifyinoherself is gauged by the result in hard cash.
These, being amateurs, and accounted
respectable, had mostly defaced instead of
embellishing nature's work; colouring blush-rose
complexions taAvny, dying dark tresses red or
yellow, blackening delicate eyebrows, tracing
obAdous violet lines on satin skins not intended
to reveal veins, and in general so upsetting all
nature's harmonies, that the end attained was
pretty much that achieved by children when,
by the help of burnt cork and mamma's
paintbox, they give themselves up to a regular bout
of play acting.


And their dress ! who shall record the
laughable errors there ?—laughable, had they not
pointed at the momentary eclipse of France's
once great priAdlege, taste ! The flowing lines
made angular, the straight lines tortured into
crookedness, puffs where there should have
been plaitings, and that flattened which should
have swelled, flowers tied down by glass beads,
feathers crushed by silver and gold, insects
crawling over lace, and birds escaping from
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 46 -->
shoulder-knots of ribbons—everywhere
deformity of contour and discordance of hue,
everywhere distortion and tumult such that,
according to Shelley's theory of the "
interpenetration of senses," ear and eye should have
equally ached at the confusion.


A loud and prolonged burst of applause
awarded to Theresa extinguished the sound of
minor conversations. When it had subsided,
the evidence of a rather lively discussion came
from the table Avhere sat the large group of
fashionable ladies and gentlemen to Avhom the
Parisians have given the names of cocodets and
cocodettes.


"Mile, de Vieupont," says Henri Dupont,
\"was a very handsome highly educated girl
Avithout a farthing, whom VouArray—like an
idiot—Avent and married, God forgive me, for
love ! She was penniless, and he gave her a
hundred and fifty thousand francs a year—is
that a fact ? Yes or no."


\"Well, but," began the small young
gentleman, with the squeaky voice; " I have heard
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 47 -->
it also said that she had to suffer a great deal
Avith Vouvray."


\"Suffer ! " echoed a very pretty little woman
with dark eyes and a green paroquet vrith a
plum in its beak, nestling in amongst the curls
of her chignon; " who would not have suffered
with such a fool as VouATray ? Why the man's
a perfect cretin!'


\"He proved it by marrying Jeanne de
Vieupont," observed Count Dupont; " and upon
my word, I hope she did suffer, that's all I
can say, for, according to my ideas, she richly
deserved it."


\"You are a positive bear," declares a
remarkably handsome blonde, Avith a quantity of
frizzled fair hair, and a plateful of strawberries
and currants on the top of her head by way of
hat. " See, there comes OliAder!" and she pointed
to where a new comer was Adsible, advancing
towards the table where sat the largest of the
groups present. " Olivier," she added
familiarly; " come here; there is room for you."  
  
  
  M. de Beauvoisin seemed to hesitate a
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 48 -->
moment, half-raised Iris hat to two ladies who
were sitting at a table in the close
neighbourhood of the one to which he Avas summoned,
and then, coming straight on, exchanged
greetings and hand-shakings with those around it.


The handsome blonde Avas apparently busy
with some detail of the attire of one of the
two ladies Avhom the Marquis de Beauvoisin
had boAved to, for as she whispered to him, the
Avords, "If it is real, it is worth ten thousand
francs at least," Avere audible; and so, shortly
after, Avere these: " I Avould give the Avorld to
knoAv Avho made it, Avhether Felicie or Worth;
couldn't you ask her ? I must have one like
it,"


Olivier seemed to elude the commission thus
half-imposed upon him, for he changed his
place. By this movement the little
blackeyed lady with the bird and plum in her
chignon was discovered as stage directions term it,
and the Marquis de Moranges suddenly added
himself to the group, seizing both hands of this
lively personage and exclaiming,—
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 49 -->

\"A la bonne heure, princess! so you have
come back to us at last."


These two, plunging at once into the noisiest
and apparently most diverting of conversations,
the blonde lady, not used, as it seemed, to be
unattended to, deliberately rose, and seated
herself next to M. de Beauvoisin, and right
opposite to the magnificent mantilla of Aleneon
lace worn by the Sphinx (for she it was), and
touching the genuineness whereof she had been
so anxious.


At the end of a few minutes Olivier was
drawn forcedly into a whispered
conversation, mixed up Avith dainty fan-tappings
and loud laughter on the lady's part, and
now and then she obliged him to bend
doAvn so low and so near to her to catch
her words that her fair hair touched his
cheek.


The Sphinx sat right opposite to them,
silent, and feeding upon what she saw "with
her glowering eyes. Her lips grew with every
second more tightly compressed, and her cheek  
  
  
  E  
  
  
  VOL. II.
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 50 -->
paler, Avhilst her eyes eat, as it were,
corrosively into what they gazed upon.


Hoav long she thus sat she knew not, it
seemed a long space of time; but at last she
could bear it no longer.


"Aspasie," said she, in a hoarse whisper,
\"look across there; Avho is that fair woman ?
there! Avith the strawberries in her hair ? I
knoAv her face."


\"That!" answered Mile. Mourjon, with a
wicked laugh, " that's the famous Duchesse de
Varignan."


\"I thought so," gasped Claudine; " not even
one of us ! "


\"That's as it may be," sneered Aspasie;
\"her set call her respectable. I believe her to
be M. de Beauvoisin's mistress but good
heavens ! what is the matter, madame, are you
ill ?" she exclaimed, as she felt Claudine's hold
on her arm relax suddenly.  
  
  
  The Sphinx had apparently fainted.


And over this, too, the eternal stars looked
serenely down.
<!-- Leaf 61 -->
  
  CHAPTER V.  
  
  
  ON THE SCENT.


When Claudine fainted she did not fall
senseless to the ground—as happens so
frequently in romances, but rarely anywhere else;
she leaned back upon her chair, and, whilst
her hand relaxed its hold on her companion's
arm, her head inclined towards her companion's
shoulder, so that Aspasie had only to move
slightly forwards in order to support the
Sphinx's falling weight.


Without raising her voice Mile, de
Mourjonville requested help from two of the
bystanders, strangers to her, but
gentlemenlylooking men, and, Avithout any noise or fuss,
Claudine was removed from the battle-field
where she had been wounded. As (like most
people in similar cases) she was not wholly  
  
  
  E 2
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 52 -->
inanimate, she Avas quickly and quietly
conveyed to her OAvn carriage, and transported to
the Hotel de Moranges, under the watchful
Aspasie's care.


The entire scene passed, however, under the
eyes of the tAvo men Avhom it most nearly
concerned, and who stirred not one step.


{empty}M. de Moranges' attention Avas suddenly
arrested by the movement Aspasie made to
prevent Claudine from falling, but he had not
caught the expression of intense anxiety Avith
which Aspasie had been questioned by the
Sphinx. Olivier de Beauvoisin had, and
understood the whole in an instant, though his
mental faculties, as Ave know, were not
remarkable for brightness.


But both men sat still, in the face of the
stricken Traviata, because both, Avhatever their
other faults, Avere perfectly Avell bred, and
knew how to live, as the French phrase runs.


The uncle did not look at his nepheAV, nor
the nephew at his uncle, for very different
reasons; neither did they seem to have eyes
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 53 -->
for Avhat was happening opposite to them, but
Avatching Claudine through their eye-lids, as
one would suppose, she was as though they
knew her not.


{empty}M. de Moranges pursued his lively talk Avith
the loud, rattling princess, who really had
noticed nothing, and than whom the parrot
Avith its plum in her chignon was not more
indifferent. He lost not a detail of what
passed (he seldom did, being an acute observer
at all times), and saw two young men, both of
Avhom he knew, help to bear away the person
who did the honours of his house; but the
keenest scrutiny would have failed to discover
in him the faintest trace of emotion.


Olivier, too, went on whispering with
Madame de Varignan, and being whispered
to; but the blonde Duchess's notice had been
too much riveted to the mantilla of Point
d'Alencon not to perceive the disappearance of
its wearer.


\"I wonder what's the matter with her?" said
she; " finds it too hot, perhaps."
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 54 -->

\"May be the smell of the flowers," suggested
Olivier.


\"Well," resumed the Duchess, casting a
glance in the direction of the Sphinx's noAv
empty seat, " I didn't think they, of that class,
Avere so nervous. Why are they called files
de marbre ? "  
  
  
  And then, after a momentary pause,—


\"I suppose it's not the nerves, only the
hearts that are marble."


And then they talked and laughed on, and
conversation became, by turns, general, or
relapsed into asides, and it Avas late when the
pleasant group broke up.


\"You may give me a fist in your brougham,
Ofrvier," said M. de Moranges, as, haAdng
parted from the ladies of their party, he found
himself standing by his nephew's side on the
asphalte of the Champs Elysees; " my carriage
is gone home Avith Claudine."


Olivier accepted with readiness, and drove
his uncle to the Rue de Grenelle. They spoke
little, and, what they did say, related to the
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 55 -->
new ballet Avhich Avas just then in rehearsal at
the opera, and to the difficulty of obtaining
good pointers.


When the Marquis de Moranges was inside
his own doors he inquired for both Claudine
and Mile, de Mourjonville, and was informed
that both had retired for the night, and were
asleep. As he was assured by Madame's
Avaiting-maid that her indisposition had been
nothing to speak of, and merely an effect of
the heat, he did not think it necessary to
interrupt Mademoiselle's slumbers, which he would
otherwise have had small scruple in doing, but
left her to repose in peace.


But peace was not precisely the grand
desideratum in our friend, Aspasie's, so recently
and so widely-opened eyes. What she was
bent upon was conviction, and she set to work
with all the sharp cunning of her nature.


Never was anything so sisterly as the care
lavished by her upon Claudine during their
drive home. The latter, haAdng partially
recovered from the first shock before she was
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 56 -->
placed in the carriage, Avas merely struggling
Avith the oppression and breathlessness that so
frequently folioav these kind of attacks. Her
memory aa^is still somewhat dim as to the
immediate cause of what she Avas suffering;
and she alighted at the Hotel de Moranges,
and, supported by Mile, de Mourjonville,
tottered into her OAvn room, before the clear
and distinct sense of what had passed
reappeared before her mental Adsion. But it did
re-appear, and then the natural consequence of
all such emotions in Avomen manifested itself
in another attack.


The sagacious Aspasie had at once
dismissed the lady's-maid, saying that " Madame,
Avhenever she had such attacks as these" (it
Avas the first she had ever had in her life),
\"liked best to be alone;" that she (Mile.
de Mourjonville) Avas used to attend upon her
in such cases, and that, in fact, the patient
would be fast asleep in a quarter of an hour.
Aspasie said this in such a quiet, pleasant way,
and it Avas so particularly agreeable to the
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 57 -->
abigail to be left to her oavti devices, and
released from any performance of any duty,
that she, in her OAvn mind, voted Mademoiselle
a sensible person, and one with whom it might,
perhaps, be possible to live.


Aspasie let the nervous attack have entirely
its own way, merely undoing all strings,
ribbons, and ligatures, establishing the sufferer
comfortably on a sofa, and opening Avindows so
as to let in air.


When the paroxysm was over, and
exhaustion showed that it was so, she prepared a glass
of eau sucree, with essence of lime and orange
floAvers in it, and gently bathed Avith Eau de
Cologne the head that lay back, inert and pale,
upon the sofa cushions.


Claudine's breath went and came
imperceptibly between her half-closed, slightly coloured
lips, and her eyelids were shut as in sleep,
Avhile a dark blue circle hollowed itself beneath
each eye. Prostration was complete. Aspasie
touched the cold wrist; the pulse was barely
perceptible; and not fussy, but watchful as a
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 58 -->
cat, she glided softly round her prey, seeking
for the spot whence she could best pounce
morally upon it.


Her first move was to impress upon her
halfunconscious hearer her OAvn complete and
absolute want of suspicion.


\"It was the Avorst of those hot, crowded
places under the trees of the Champs Elysees,"
she said; " they invariably produced faintness "
(she had herself had so many of these attacks,
she knew so thorougldy Avell how to deal with
them)! " Tilleul was the only thing quite
sovereign;" and she obtained the swallowing
of a few drops of her cordial. Then she
touched the hand again; the pulse Avas still
very weak. She put a bottle of English salts
at a convenient distance from her patient's
nose. " It was such tremendously hot weather,
too, for the season; so unwholesome, she
Avondered anyone could bear it; she herself
had felt very unwell for several days past.
The greatest wonder of all to her was, however,
the extraordinary physical strength of fine
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 59 -->
ladies; they went everywhere, did everything,
turned night into day, but did not rest during
the day; and yet they were always fresh and
strong. How did they manage it ?


\"Only see that Madame de Varignan, for
instance," she added; " she's as blooming as a
rose (not that I think her so handsome as do
some people), and I dare say never had a
fainting fit in all her life ! So self-satisfied, too, as
she looks ! so insolently happy !"


The pulse on which Aspasie had laid her
finger wdiile thus speaking gave a little sudden
start, and beat intermittently.


"Fine ladies have a fine time of it,"
continued Aspasie, dropping the hand she -had
held, as, moving to a table that stood before a
glass, she began to mix some lemonade for
herself, while watching the recumbent figure of
her friend in the mirror. " Fine ladies have a
fine time of it, in truth; they have all the
pleasures of Avrong and all the privileges of
right; they lay hands on whatever suits them,
and nobody ever cries out about stolen goods;
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 60 -->
and they abuse the poor, unfortunate Avomen
Avho happen to have hearts."


She had turned round, and Avhilst uttering
the last words, she stood in front of Claudine,
Avhose face was bathed in tears.


\"What has happened ?" she exclaimed, Avith
such an accent of innocent surprise; and
springing forwards, she, Avith a burst of
irrepressible sympathy, well nigh smothered
Claudine in her' arms, overwhelming her Avith
marks of her tender commiseration, and
imploring pardon for the Avounds she had been
blindly, unconsciously inflicting.


\"I had not the slightest notion," she cried;
\"not a guess : if I could have had the faintest
idea of such a thing," (of Avhat, Aspasie ?) " I
Avould have died sooner than say a word."


\"Aspasie ? " asked Claudine, suddenly
drying her eyes, dashing the hair from her brows,
and fixing a look of fire upon her companion;
\"do people think her so very beautiful ? "


Mile, de Mourjonville had measured the
depth of anxiety in the look, and, after a
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 61 -->
moment of apparent reluctance at having to avTow
a painful truth,—


\"Yes," she replied, " she is thought in her
world a great beauty; indeed, quite
irresistible." This was uttered in a low, regretful
tone.


Claudine sat upright, gazing steadfastly at
her friend, who was kneeling on a cushion
beside the sofa, and Avith quivering lips and
nostril, and a brow knit in wrath like the
Medusa's,—


\"Do you believe she is his mistress ?" asked
a voice, hoarse Avith anger and dread.


The glance with which Mile, de Mourjonville
took the entire aspect of the woman before
her was a short one, no longer than a lightning
flash, but it told volumes.


\"No," said she, deliberately, and, as it were,
driving a nail home Avith one knock.


\"No ?" echoed Claudine, her whole
countenance passing through half-a-dozen different
expressions in a second.  
  
  
  " No," repeated, stoutly, Aspasie, and, this
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 62 -->
time, a smile of superiority, of triumph, almost
wreathed her thin lips.


The two women were locked for a moment
or two in a slight embrace.  
  
  
  At the end of that time.


\"And Monsieur le Marquis ?" suggested
Aspasie; " how is he to be told ? Am I to
have the honour of "


But Claudine had started to her feet, and
stood pale and trembling, a very picture of
alarm.


\"Hush ! " she whispered; " for God's sake,
hush! he must never know : I would rather
die!"


\"Oh," remarked Mile, de Mourjonville,
arching her eyebrows, and feigning astonishment;
\"so you go in for concealment, do you 1 that
will be no easy matter."


Claudine joined her hands in earnest
entreaty.


\"Aspasie," exclaimed she, " you must help
us; you will promise, will you not ? You will
swear never to tell M. de Moraneres ? "
<!-- Leaf 73 -->
  
  ON THE SCENT. 63

\"Oh, yes," rejoined Aspasie, with a singular
expression; " I will promise never to tell him
—till you wish it."
<!-- Leaf 74 -->
  
  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  DUST IN THE EYES.


If our wily friend, Mile, de Mourjonville,
saw that, by this new complication of
Claudine's passion for M. de Beauvoisin, she
became what French politicians call the master
of the situation, she also perceived, at the
same moment, the intersection of difficulties
in which it suddenly placed her. There was
fortune on all sides, and one false step, or
one unlucky chance, might destroy it. For
the false step, Aspasie thought she could
answer that it should not be taken by her.
But as far as the unlucky chance went, there
was no saying what might not happen.


The Dowager might be brought, Aspasie
believed, to a very large contribution, if it
were proved to her that her brother's fortune
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 65 -->
was definitively snatched from the grasp of the
Sphinx; but the bare notion of Olivier being
the instrument destined by Providence to prove
Claudine's unworthiness to his uncle, tore the
entire web to pieces. It cut two ways : first,
if ever it were so much as guessed at by M.
de Moranges, not one farthing of his money
would ever find its way to his lawful heir's
purse; and the Dowager herself wrould be far
more terrified at the idea of her son's
infatuation than at that even of her brother's.


So far, then, the combination was a very
unlucky one. But Mile, de Mourjonville was
a remarkably cool-headed person, who, like a
good general, seized all the various aspects of
a position at once, and was not easy to
disconcert. She was resolute exceedingly; despised
the thousand and one petty phantoms before
which it is the habit of continentals (men and
women) to be for ever quaking; rose at once
to the requirements of the position; and took
in all its different bearings at a glance.  
  
  
  Claudine was in love with M. de Beauvoisin  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  F
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 66 -->
—that fact must be accepted and made the
best of. Claudine's entire unreserved
confidence must be secured, the total ignorance of
the Marquis de Moranges must be compassed,
and upon those two bases a comparatively
quiet state of things being established, some
wise scheme must be invented whereby later
to loosen the bonds between the Sphinx and
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin. For the moment, Aspasie
saw clearly that any jealousy or disquietude on
Claudine's part would lead to some violent
explosion which would reveal all to M. de
Moranges, and deprive her, Mile, de
Mourjonville, of her legitimate share of profits in the
concern; therefore, there should be no
outbreak of any species, she argued : i.e. no
occasion afforded for one. She determined to take
time into her counsels, and trust somewhat to
the fickleness and frivolity of man's (and
woman's) nature.


\"Let her have her toy;" she mentally
reasoned, " and tire of it!"  
  
  
  What puzzled Mile, de Mourjonville not a
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 67 -->
little, was the absolutely frightful anxiety
evinced by Claudine that M. de Moranges
should suspect nothing. This anxiety seemed
to outweigh almost the passion for Olivier,
whilst at the same time identifying itself wdth
it. Aspasie was at fault, and for that reason
proceeded cautiously; but she clearly saw
what a hold the dread of discovery gave her
over the Sphinx, and this cord she grasped
firmly.


\"Madame de Varignan has one great
advantage over you," said Mile, de Mourjonville
to Claudine, as they were sitting together a
few days after the scene in the Champs
Ely sees; " she can see as much of him as she
chooses."


\"She seems to be always with his wdfe,"
rejoined Claudine. " What an extraordinary
thing that in their world women seem to have
no jealousy."


\"Why should they ?" retorted Aspasie; " the
sort of sentiment they are taught to have
for their husbands, when they marry, is of  
  
  
  F 2
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 68 -->
such a very calm description that how it could,
by any possibility, engender jealousv would
indeed be a miracle."


\"But, Aspasie," continued Claudine, drawing
her chair nearer, and leaning forwards with
her elbows resting on her knees, " what is the
difference in reality between them and us ?
We are, after all, the same flesh and blood,—
we lead the same lives,-—what real difference
is there % Do you think they are better than
we are ?"


\"I should say considerably worse," replied
Mile. Mourjon, with a malignant smile; "
besides, if there are any what are called good
ones among them, nobody runs after them—
they are left to sit by themselves in a corner."


\"It is just that I can never understand,"
continued Claudine; " there is Olivier's wife;
she is what people call good."


\"She's not tempted, that's all! " interrupted
Aspasie.  
  
  
  Claudine shook her head. " No ! no ! " added

she; " she's good, and I know it."
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 69 -->

\"Stuff! " exclaimed angrily Mademoiselle
Mourjonville; " she's not had time yet to know
whether she's good or bad—wait a year or two,
and you'll soon see she's no better than the
others—everybody's the same."


\"No! Aspasie, that's not what I meant
when I asked where was the difference? There
is a difference between Madame de Beauvoisin
and us, and I don't mind it. I don't mind her
being good, it doesn't hurt me; but what
troubles me are the other Avomen, those like
that horrid insolent Duchess " (and her whole
countenance darkened with hate). " Why is it
that a woman like the Marquise de Beauvoisin
can go about all day long with her, and look
in public as though she was her dearest friend;
and yet, if I was to come against her in the
crowd, she would take up her gown to prevent
its folds from touching me ! What is the real
difference between Madame de Varignan and
me ? that does trouble me, and I never can
make it out."  
  
  
  " Why, there is but one; that she is Madame
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 70 -->
la Duchesse de Varignan. You need seek no
further—that will do."


\"WeU, I know," said Claudine; " but then
why do the priests always tell you that we are
all equals, and that sin only makes the
difference ? I feel it isn't true, and yet I hear
them always saying it every time I go to
church."


\"Don't go to church," said, tartly, Mile, de
Mourjonville. " It's a very bad habit in your
position."


\"Well, sometimes it's a comfort," suggested
Claudine, meekly; " and then, Monsieur le
Marquis seems to think it proper."


\"Oh! Monsieur le Marquis, Monsieur le
Marquis!" grumbled Aspasie; "I am
perfectly certain you will not be able to carry on
this system of deception much longer. Why
not make an effort, and get over all this
nonsense about Olivier ? it would only be the
affair of a week at most. Get plenty of
amusement during that time, or tell the doctors to
send you to some watering-place for your
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 71 -->
health—it would be easy to do, and you would
be free again in no time."


\"I cannot," answered Claudine, in a low tone,
but quietly; " it is beyond my strength to try
and break Avith Olivier."


A little later M. de Moranges entered the
room, and after a few phrases exchanged with
Claudine and her lady-in-waiting, he inquired
what their plans were for the evening.


\"As M. le Marquis dines in the country,"
responded Mile, de Mourjonville; " Madame
had thought of taking a box at the Gymnase,
and going to see the new play, with M. de
Vivienne, M. de Mauriac, and M. de Nesves."


\"Florestan de Nesves ? " asked the Marquis,
sharply, and then with a smile that seemed
somehow premeditated, " he dined here the
day before yesterday," added he, " and went to
the opera in your box last night."


"You know, M. le Marquis," observed
blandly Mile, de Mourjonville; " M. le Comte
de Nesves was so very kind the other night at
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 72 -->
the Champs Elysdes when Madame fainted;
he was so very empress^; and called here the
next day."


\"And has been here every day since," added
{empty}M. de Moranges; "Well, you had, perhaps,
better write a line to my nephew, about
tonight; get Olivier to go with you, too, to the
play."


\"The Marquis de Beauvoisin being a
married man, of course one does not quite feel so
authorised to dispose of his time," argued
Aspasie, with delightful propriety, and
preparing to write the note.


\"Oh! married, married," repeated M. de
Moranges; " what does that signify ? Olivier
will always do anything for me," and giving a
glance at his watch, he prepared to leave the
room, but turning round before shutting the
door; " Florestan de Nesves is a sad Don
Juan," observed he, with a laugh, " you
must be upon your guard, or people will
talk."  
  
  
  " Oh ! Monsieur le Marquis ! " exclaimed
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 73 -->
  
  Mile, de Mourjonville, with a profound
expression of offended purity, and M. de Moranges
was gone.  
  
  
  
\"We have found the paratonnerre at last,"
whispered Aspasie, as she turned towards
Claudine, who sat still, looking uneasy and
pale.
<!-- Leaf 84 -->
  
  CHAPTER VII.  
  
  
  A DISCOVERY.


Claudine's desire to keep M. de Moranges
in the dark, which so much puzzled Mile, de
Mourjonville, is not, after all, very difficult of
explanation. To her, the state to which M. de
Morano-es had raised her was the realisation of
a fairy tale. At first the sensation was a
comparatively vague one; pleasant at all times,
though uncondensed in any specific shape. But
when the hour came, when the woman awoke,
all these brilliant aspects, all these bright, fair,
outward semblances of life, meant one
thingonly : the possibility of charming Olivier !


It was not so long since that she had been
poor, dirty, abject; she remembered it well,
remembered it not with her memory alone, but
with her imagination heated and heightened by
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 75 -->
passion. Every now and then when the
evidences of luxury blazed around her in flashing
lights, in dazzling mirrors, in crystals, and gold
and silver plate, when every sense was solicited
and flattered by what boundless wealth alone
could procure,, a shadow would darken all to
the eyes of Claude Raynal's daughter, and a
chill would pass over her that made her limbs
quiver. She saw again that pale, dirty,
draggletailed girl, crawling along the wet road, with
her feet crying plash ! plash ! in her shoes, and
at those moments she dared not look at Olivier,
for she was certain he remembered it too.
She heard the sentence he had passed upon
her:—  
  
  
  " The poor are always ugly! "


He had said it, and condemned her with
the words. Therefore she would not be

poor.


Often, when all were at rest in the Hotel de
Moranges, this girl would get up, and with a
small lamp in her hand, steal away to her
wardrobe, an apartment set aside on purpose
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 76 -->
for the reception of whatever appertained to her
outward attire.


It was a large room furnished all round with
alternate glasses reaching from floor to ceiling,
and presses of pale straw coloured satin wood.
On either side was a smaller room, in which in
various drawers, cases, or boxes, were kept the
jewels, besides the less voluminous articles of
mere toilette, such as bonnets, ribbons, laces,
flowers, &c. In the larger room there were the
dresses only.


Here then would Claudine repair, in the
middle of the night, and locking the doors
inside, light all the tapers which illumined the
central room, and pass the solitary review of
her forces, of the auxiliaries which were to
secure her against the desertion of her
handsome lover.


She would open press after press, and spread
forth to view the damasks and satins, and
velvets, and oriental stuffs that were to keep
out of sight the phantom of the starving girl in
the old torn grey shawl.
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 77 -->

\"Feed her ! " had said Henri Dupont—
who had admired her! even then admired
her!


She would let the rich draperies drop, and
scrutinise the rounded outlines of her neck and
arms, and a smile of satisfaction Avould
involuntarily curl her lips. Yes ! that work was done;
she had been fed and she was beautiful! but
the costly attributes Avithout which the modern
loATer sees no fairness in beauty's very self,
they must be there also, or she would become
as nothing in his eyes.


This wTas the secret Aspasie could not fathom:
this was the chain that bound Claudine so
indissolubly to M. de Moranges.


He Avas her beauty ! he was her power!
without the glory which he gave her, she
would forfeit Olivier's love. M. de Moranges
stood between her and the repetition of the
sentence : " The poor are always ugly ! " and
then, unseen by mortal eye amidst the
splendours of that illuminated chamber, she would
fold the precious stuffs to her bosom, crush the
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 78 -->
falls of ancient Alencon betAveen her fingers,
and rapturously kiss the gems which she
fastened flashing upon her arms. She Avas safe !
Olivier could not choose but love these priceless
unparalleled signs of wealth ! and these signs
of wealth bore name the Marquis de Moranges.


Mile, de Mourjonville could not, for the life
of her, unravel the enigma, but saAV clearly that
to the successfulness of the plan for deceiving
{empty}M. de Moranges Avas somehoAv attached the
Avhole soul of the Sphinx.


The resources of her genius soon quieted her
as to any danger of detection by her employer,
but she was not long without anxiety as to
Avhat regarded M. de Beauvoisin. One or two
slight incidents served to mark, as she thought,
a desire on his part to escape from the
entanglement into which he had (perhaps
unintentionally) been drawn, and this had each
time been the signal for such an explosion of
despair on Claudine's part that the sagacious
lady-in-Avaiting felt she must quickly secure to
herself the same hold over M. de Beauvoisin
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 79 -->
that she had over the Sphinx, if she Avere not
prepared for the ruin of all her combinations.


A party to Fontainebleau had been organised
with the (now) ineAdtable M. de Nesves, and
Olivier, at his uncle's request, had promised to
take care of Madame Claudine (the Marquis
abominated expeditions of this kind), Avhen
suddenly, the day but one before the appointed
time for the pic-nic, Olivier announced the
impossibility for him to join the party.


It was at the H6tel de Moranges. A large
dinner had been given, and all the salons Avere
opened. The master of the house was playing
billiards with an ambassador newly arrived in
Paris, in whose honour the banquet had been
given, whilst in the room where the piano stood
-were gathered several young men, amongst
Avhom were Florestan de Nesves, Henri Dupont,
and M. de Beauvoisin. Conversation flagged.
Claudine's silence was habitual, but there
rested a shadoAv on her pale face and gloomy
eyes that seemed to spread over all those wTho
surrounded her. Our friend, Aspasie, too, was
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 80 -->
thoughtful and uncommunicative, and Avhen
not observed, concentrated all the intense
sharpness of her gaze upon Olivier.


She had asked him with the most insinuating
of voices, whether " nothing " could make him
alter his determination touching the party to
Fontainebleau, and he had alluded to his
mother, as though some dire decree of that
undisputed puissance baffled him, and forbade his
pleasure.


Claudine was besought to sing, but said she
could not, which seemed true.


\"M. le Marquis," suggested Mile, de
Mourjonville, to Olivier, " suppose you favour ns
Avith La chanson de Fortunio; it is one of your
triumphs."


And so Olivier did, and very well indeed he
sang it. In the middle of the praise he earned,
Avhen a moment's silence Avas secured,  
  
  
  ■j


\"No one ever sang that so well since Camille
Leblond," vouchsafed Aspasie, in the clearest
tones of her remarkably clear voice. " Did
you learn it from her ?"
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 81 -->

{empty}M. de Beauvoisin had slightly started at the
first words, and then sat immoveably still; but
try what he would to hide it, a keen observer
might have noted a change in his
countenance.


\"I—I don't think I ever heard her sing it,"
he replied, Avith some hesitation.


When tea was served, Mile, de Mourjonville,
choosing a moment when Olivier was
standingalone, turning over the leaves of a music-book,
approached him and most gracefully handed
him a cup. Their eyes met, and under the
momentary look, commented by a remarkably
singular smile that Aspasie gave him, the young
Marquis blushed crimson.


\"You did not knoAv," said she, sweetly, but
not releasing him from the hold of her eye,
\"that Camille was my half-sister, did you ?"


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin turned very pale, and Avhen
the party to Fontainebleau Avas again spoken
of, he said he would positively try to get over
his engagement to his mother.  
  
  
  " What it is to be so clever!" remarked a

young gentleman just budding forth into the

world; " see how Mile. Aspasie does what she

likes with Beauvoisin."

Claudine was radiant.
<!-- Leaf 93 -->
  
  CHAPTER VIII.  
  
  
  MONSIEUR LE MARQUIS.


At the time when our tale opens, the Marquis
was fifty-five, and looked his age. Neither
older nor younger, but what a strong healthy
man at that age should look.


He had been from his boyhood remarkably
handsome, Avith always the beauty fitted to his
age of the hour. At fifty-five he was the
handsomest man of his time, and looked a
king. He was tall and portly, rather stout
than otherwise, as a man in the middle of life
should be, if the weight he has borne already
have not weakened him, and he is still ready
for the load that coming years Avill impose.


Full of grace and dignity, at his ease with
all men (and women), from potentates to
peasants, the Marquis de Moranges was, to a  
  
  
  G 2
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 84 -->
philosophical observer, one of the chief studies
which the higher classes of Paris society could
offer to him, for he bore witness to a state of
things, and to a race unrecalled by anything
that the present epoch has to show. Look at
him as he sits his broadchested, firm-footed,
glossy coated weight-carrier in the Bois; see
how he sits, one with his steed, enfleshed, as it
were, upon the noble brute; mark his elboAvs,
his knees, and his hand ! All is close (nothing
rambling), and all is steady, tight-fitting, sure,
and neat. Look at him in a salon Avhere men
are assembled, who love to talk, and listen to
him there. His words are so many evidences
of a state of culture which is gone, but in Avhich
was embodied France. Whether it is
irretrievably gone, time will show.


Such as he is, royal looking as Charlemagne,
(but the Charlemagne of the period of the
Capitularies) stately, active, energetic, full of
intellect and will, does M. de Moranges, at
fifty-five, mature only, ripe, unmarked by one
defect brought on by age, does this man seem
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 85 -->
a fitting subject whereupon a Avoman should
try to practise deceit ?


That a Avoman should do so—and above all,
she who is nothing more but a mere woman
only—seems out of the nature of things; but
hoAv about self-deceit ? Might this man not
deceive himself ? Has his maturity left him  
  
  
  no secret of his being unrevealed ? Or are

there in him undeveloped springs Avhereof he
is himself unsuspicious ?


Of that portion of the human organisation,
known by the name of the heart, M. de
Moranges Avas utterly ignorant. Perhaps if one
Avas to incline toAvards the over-technicality of
this age, it might be hard to define what is
really meant by the term, applied as it
perpetually is to things Avherewith it has
absolutely nothing to do; but something must be
granted; therefore we will assume that the
Avord heart means the medium through AAdiich
the tenderer affections are felt; the chief
element of unselfishness in man. This it was
Avhereof the magnificent Marquis knew nothing.
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 86 -->

Some men let their hearts (or what they
take for granted as such) lie about, so that
they come to be picked up and laid down
again twenty times within a twelvemonth, by
Avhich process they are rendered considerably
Aveaker, but not better, although these kind of
men aspire to being deemed tender hearted.


Others there are, who shut their hearts up,
or fancy they do so, decreeing that they shall
be put away, got rid of, for fear lest they
should one day be troublesome or inconvenient,
as though it lay within the poAver of a man to
come to a compromise Avith his Maker, and
escape from this or that portion of his
complete humanity!


Noav, Maurice de Moranges Avas still one of
the king's pages, and had not quite attained
his fifteenth year, AAThen his precocious wisdom,
prompted by a strangely developed love of
self, came to the conclusion that perfect
devotion to self Avas safer and pleasanter than
devotion to anybody else.  
  
  
  It was a narroAV creed, and a mistake; but
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 87 -->
{empty}M. de Moranges had not yet discovered this,
at fifty-five. He had lived Avith the truly
beautiful in art, until, by dint of forging the
fine ore of his nature, his perceptions had
reached a degree of refinement, where the
exquisite, the perfect, alone can satisfy. And he
thought that a mind, thus accustomed to the
lovely, could altogether do without what is
conventionally termed the heart, and associate
itself Avith senses ministered to by the impure.


When the Marquis first appropriated Claude
Raynal's daughter to himself, he did so with
the intention of fashioning her to his taste, of
educating her, and, in a certain degree, creating
her anew. But he, over-learned as he was in
all the phenomena of life, even he, had
committed a tremendous mistake, for he had
counted Avithout the vrdgar element, without
the inferior nature that would rise no higher
than its own level.


The Marquis was not long in finding out the
difficulty of giving the direction he desired to
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 88 -->
his pupil, but, though disappointed on this
point, his vanity Avas amply satisfied on others,
by the celebrity soon achieved by the Sphinx;
and extremely pleasant it became to him to
reflect upon his envied proprietorship of this
universally admired person.


But the impossible—that, namely, which he
and whosoever kneAv him Avould have declared
impossible—came to pass (as it so often does)
and M. de Moranges' placid vanity, that calm,
serene surface which nothing had as yet ruffled,
Avas disturbed.


{empty}M. de Moranges supposed that lo\Te had
awarded to him Avhatsoever Avas in its gift, and
that about love he had nothing left to learn !
The exact contrary was the truth. Love had
given him nothing, and of Avhat is in reality
love, he Avas more ignorant than a school-girl.
Maurice de Moranges had been loved too early
and too much to have acquired even the
alphabet of the science of loving; that sad,
sweet, sacred science, never Avholly mastered
but through misery and through the
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 89 -->
subordination of self to the beloved. Neither do I
mean to assert that it is in such natures as his
ever to achieve the greatness of a real passion,
but it is in all men to suffer, and the unknoAvn
is a terrible enemy.


Since the day when heaven only knows
Avhat mysterious vibration in Claudine's noAV
passionate voice had jarred upon some secret
fibre in the Marquis' complex being, and
stirred emotions lying slumber-locked till then,
his perfect quietude was disturbed, but
pleasantly so; and remembering the numerous
episodes of his gaily mis-spent youth, he began
to foresee a repetition of them wdth the Sphinx.


The disturbance Avas but a slight one, and
the selfishness remained untouched: so
thoroughly so that, when in the Champs Elysees,
{empty}M. de Moranges saw Claudine fainting before
his eyes, the emotion caused by that event
Avas so slight as not to be worth mentioning.
He was perfectly satisfied by the accounts
he obtained of her health when he reached
his own house, and had the goodness before
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 90 -->
dropping off to sleep, to think complacently
over several plans for future pleasures graciously
shared Avith Claudine—perhaps even a journey
to some German Avatering-place; though it
might be better after all to let her go there
alone if her health required it. Well! all that
might be settled at leisure: there was no hurry.
Claudine belonged to him absolutely, to do
what he chose with; but it was pleasant to
think that she was becoming more attractive
to him, her proprietor; that she had all at
once found a Aroice that charmed him, and was
beginning to sing in a way that said
somethingeven to him! All this was agreeable, and he
slept peacefully upon it.


But the next day the roused emotions
suddenly condensed themselves into a neAv form.
A name Avas uttered, a shock was given, and
the recently-touched fibres vibrated to a
different tone. This time it Avas an unpleasant
vibration, but connected—as, according to
some theories, are dreams—with the memories
of by-gone events.
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 91 -->

When Maurice de Moranges was a page,
the Comte de Nesves (father to Florestan) was
a reigning Don Juan of the time, and he it
was who had been the occasion of the first
severe lesson taught the boy, whose renoAvn
was later to eclipse that of all former
conquerors. Of AA^hat he had done Nesves never
guessed the importance, but though Moranges
easily grew to despise the lesson and its cause,
he never pardoned the giver of it. He had all
his life disliked the name of Nesves, and it
grated upon him harshly wdien Aspasie (who
knew nothing of the past) pronounced it.


Like all his family, M. de Moranges was
brave to excess, and he forthwith invited
Florestan de Nesves to his house, and opened
its doors to him just as his grandfather
plunged into the movement of '89, in order to
prove to himself that he could fear none.


But the jarred fibre went on jarring, and
the anxiety endured. He breathed uneasily,
as though there were some oppression at the
heart. The heart! as if it had not been got
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 92 -->
  
  rid of ages ago! got rid of ? who knoAVS ?
Kept out of sight ? yes. But could it by any
chance have taken to beating again ? The
very notion Avas preposterous—nay,
humiliating—and the Marquis trampled it doAvn
scornfully.
<!-- Leaf 103 -->
  
  CHAPTER IX.  
  
  
  CROSS PURPOSES.


Mlle. de Mourjonville felt herself armed
at all points, save one. She had a hold over
Claudine Avhich she kneAv to be irresistible.
She had a hold over Olivier which she thought
he would not resist, and, indeed, since the
moment when she informed him of her close
connection with the cause of his youthful
follies, she had had no complaint to make of
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin. He was docile in the
extreme, though he evinced a certain
disquietude of manner whenever he happened to
be left alone Avith her. With the Dowager,
the practical Aspasie felt most of all at her
ease, and relied upon her OAvn resources for
giAdng to that alliance an indissoluble firmness.
It was with her own immediate employer,
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 94 -->
only, that the lady-in-Avaiting could not exactly
make out her position, and what was its
Aveakness or its strength. Yet this was, after all,
the most important part of the Avhole scheme;
for, necessary as it might be to have
subjugated Claudine and Olivier, and secured the
DoAvager, the necessity of remaining certain of
her establishment at the Hotel de Moranges
Avas paramount to all others. With one word.
the Marquis could scatter the threads of her
combinations, Avell-Avoven though they Avere,
to the Avinds. He had but to groAv the least
in the world dissatisfied with her, and her
utility was at an end. Of Avhat use could she
be to the Dowager if she Avere dismissed from
her post as companion to Claudine ?


{empty}M. de Moranges, too, Avas the reverse of a
man easy to manage, as it is termed, nor was
clever management in this case a thing called
for, or in any Avay feasible. Mile. Aspasie
might manage M. de Beauvoisin and Claudine,
and to a certain extent, the sharp Dowager
herself; but in Avhat shape could management
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 95 -->
of any kind be applicable to the head of the
house, Avhose deputy housekeeper she was ?
She was his servant—there Avas no denying
that; and the instant in which he should
esteem her services less than he noAv
apparently did, would be the last of her rule. If
for the double of her salary (Avhich Avas high)
{empty}M. de Moranges could find a person suiting
him better, he would engage that person, and
Mile, de Mourjonville would be deposed. Not
all her regularity, not all the economy she
Avas capable of introducing into certain
branches of the internal expenditure, nothing
of all this would weigh one feather's Aveight
with Moranges. He liked regularity and
punctuality, but for economy cared nothing;
on the contrary, some of his friends said there
was such a deep rooted after-me-the-deluge
feeling in him that he preferred waste to
anything in the shape of saAdng. No—it all
depended on one thing only, on the mere fact
of suiting him. Hitherto Aspasie knew that
she suited him; but she also aw^oke to the
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 96 -->
consciousness that, upon continuing to suit him,
hung all her chances of existence.


Destiny helped her, but Avithout her being
thoroughly aAvare that she was helped.


When she first mentioned the name of M.
de Nesves to the Marquis de Moranges, it was
altogether Avithout a purpose that she did so.
It Avas his manner of receiving the
communication that inspired her with a purpose; for,
impenetrable as he was renowned for being,
the imperceptible something Avhich flitted
across his features at mention of that name,
suddenly revealed to Aspasie's singularly sharp
perceptions an advantage that must not be
allowed to escape.

• She had secured her lightning-conductor, as
she triumphantly announced to Claudine, and
the great thing noAV was, so exclusively to
attract the lightning to this one object that it
should not let its flashes play round any
other in the neighbourhood. It was an
excellent contrivance, and showed favour on
the part of Providence toAvards that
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 97 -->
struggling and superior individual, Mile, de
Mourjonville.


Claudine learnt her lesson well enough, as it
simply implied passivity on her part, and
Florestan de Nesves (who was no genius) was
well-received Avhen he paid his court to the
Sphinx. M. de Moranges himself so completed
the plan, that no more Avas left for the ingenuity
of others to achieve. He persisted Avith such
disdainful ostentation to invite M. de Nesves,
that our friend Aspasie determined to risk a
Arery bold stroke, and feign concern for her
employer's dearest interests. She hinted one
morning, when accidentally alone Avith M. de
Moranges, that perhaps M. de Nesves came
rather often to the house; that his
reputation Avas not quite such as to Avarrant,
&c, &c.  
  
  
  But she Avas cut short somewhat harshly.


\"What can I possibly have to fear from such
a goose as Nesves ? " had M. de Moranges
replied with a haughty stare.  
  
  
  And Aspasie was considerably comforted, for  
  
  
  VOL. II. H
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 98 -->
she had made a step towards finding out what
was passing in her employer's inmost soul—no
easy task.


This mode of braving any notion of rivalry
on the part of M. de Nesves, of despising him,
was so different from the sudden manifestation
of uneasiness that had escaped M. de Moranges
on first hearing Florestan's name mentioned,
that Mile, de Mourjonville felt her employer
was playing a part, Avas disguising himself;
and that he therefore had something to hide.
Besides this, too, she had evinced such a
vigilant solicitude for his interests, and it would be
so easy at any moment to expulse the
unsuspecting Florestan from his earthly paradise,
with a prodigious sIioav of flaming swords, that
our friend Aspasie had really every reason for
congratulating herself upon her good luck, as
well as upon her cleverness.


Destiny was about to put another capital
card into her hand, but she knew nothing of it
yet. She simply went her Avay Avith the
known, leaving the unknown to take care of
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 99 -->
itself, which it did—taking care of her at the
same time.


Mile, de Mourjonville, about this period,
informed the Marquis de Moranges that Madame
Claudine's health was thought to require a
little more walking exercise, and the Sphinx
and her lady-in-waiting were accordingly Avont
to indulge in long A\Talks in the forenoon.
Sometimes a carriage conveyed them to the Bois,
leaving them there to accomplish their
pedestrian excursions unattended; sometimes their
rambles led them into the streets of Paris, Avith
the easily admitted object of shopping.


{empty}M. de Moranges was far too thorough a
grand seigneur not to believe in what was told
to him; so that opportunities were not wanting,
whether for Claudine to meet the person she
sought, or for Aspasie to concert measures Avith
those whom she aspired to turn into
instruments rather than allies.


It was towards the middle of June, and
matters were progressing well, and the last
intervieAv Mile, de Mourjonville had with the  
  
  
  u 2
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 100 -->
DoAvager had shown that lady satisfied with
Avhat had been achieved. She had heard of
the attentions paid by M. de Nesves to the
Sphinx, for Avhile her brother imagined himself
to be the only individual in the Avorld in Avhose
mind a shade of suspicion had been aroused,
and while all his efforts were directed toAvards
preventing any one else from guessing at these
vague suspicions of his, the entire crowd of his
habitual associates Avere beginning to talk
betAveen themselves, and to chuckle and laugh
over the probable fate of the kingly Marquis
de Moranges, Avho alone was completely ignorant
of Avhat Avas passing out of doors.


"It is extremely lucky that it has fallen out
as it has done," had observed the DoAvager, at
the close of the interview above alluded to;
\"nothing could have been more opportune."


Noav, these wrords, lucky and opportune, had
an unpleasant sound, and conveyed an
unpleasant sense to Mile. Aspasie's ears, and she
rebelled, and distinctly stated that there was
not an atom of luck or opportunity in the
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 101 -->
Avhole business, but that she, Mile, de
Mourjonville, and she alone, was the planner,
deviser, and, in short, creatrix of the entire
situation.


A feAV seconds sufficed to put these two
Avomen on their guard, one against the other.
Mile. Aspasie had alarmed the rapacity of
the Dowager by boasting too much of her
marvellous services, and thereby letting it be
inferred that the reward she would claim might
be disproportionately high, and the elderly
Marchioness, in the sudden aAvakening of what
Avas with her a master passion, had alloAved the
true niggardliness of her nature to peep forth,
and had disquieted Aspasie upon the amount
of her gains, which she fully intended should
be large. Each Avoman had betrayed herself;
Avhich is what mostly happens when persons of
decided moral inferiority concert together for
an evil purpose.


"The Dowager is not sufficiently in my
poAver," was the form of internal speech in
which Mile, de Mourjonville's convictions on
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 102 -->
parting from Madame de Beauvoisin condensed
themselves.


\"That creature must be squeezed dry as an
orange, and then thrown aside," was the
deliberate conclusion of the DoAvager upon that

same occasion.


Which of the two rival powers was in the
end to outwit the other, Ave shall see later;
meanAvhile, one or two of those infinitely
small things occurred, AAdiose insignificance
is such that no one ever dreams of
reverting to them as the cause of more weighty
events.


Since the diplomatic conference to which his
sister had summoned him a feAV Aveeks
preATOusly, M. de Moranges had held no further
communication with that lady, Avhose dictatorial
genius had, as Ave know, never possessed any
attraction for him. He Avas more than eATer
pleased to have Olivier about him, and
engrossed a very considerable portion of his
nepheAv's time.  
  
  
  " I am afraid I shall have to giAre up my
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 103 -->
pleasant habits of fife soon," said M. de
Beauvoisin, in a hesitating kind of way, one
eATening, as he lounged about after his usual
gracefully purposeless fashion in one of his uncle's
apartments.


\"Why ?" inquired the uncle, Avith active
anxiety; " does my niece mean to make you
go to Bareges with her ? She is ordered there,
is she not ?"


\"Oh, that is all changed now," rejoined
Olivier, wdth increasing embarrassment; for he
had had time to remark the sudden pallor on
Claudine's face, and the lynx-like look fixed
upon his oavu by Aspasie.


\"That is all altered; it is not Claire."
(Beauvoisin named his wife in this spot, which
his uncle never did; it was the difference
between the two generations.) "It is not
Claire," he added; "it is my mother. Claire
is no longer going to Bareges; we are all going
to Beauvoisin next Aveek."


\"What for %" pursued M. de Moranges.
\"It has never been your custom to go down
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 104 -->
there before the autumn. What is to make
the difference this year 1"


The steady fire of Mile, de Mourjonville's
eyes (she Avas seated at a table behind M. de
Moranges,) never ceased for an instant, and
Olivier felt that his very bones Avere being
searched by the gaze of those terribly ironical
orbs.


\"Well," he replied, not daring to look any
way at all, " the difference is made by what,
to me, is most supremely disagreeable: by
the sudden disappearance from the Avorld of
old Carpentier, and by the decision come to by
the government to let the election take place
in the second Aveek in July. It is in
yesterday's Moniteur."


{empty}M. de Moranges tapped his forehead with
his hand.


"Bless my soul!" he exclaimed;
"the.deputation ! Yes, I remember all about it now;
and there is no help for us. Your mother will
leave none of us in peace. But I thought there
were to be no elections anywhere till November."
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 105 -->

"So we all thought," said Olivier; " but
some fancy seems to haAre seized our lords and
masters, and the election is to take place
directly; as I have told you, in the second
week of next month."


\"Well, my dear boy, what must be, must
be," observed his uncle. " And hoAvever great
a bore the whole thing is, count upon me; I
aat.11 give you every help I can."


\"And so Monsieur le Marquis is about to
become the deputy for Savre-et-Merle ?"
insinuated Mile, de Mourjonville, as, somewhat
farther on in the evening, she handed him a
glass of iced orangeade.


It Avas such a gentle tone in which the
words were uttered, and such a look the
speaker of them sent creeping all over the
man she addressed! However, there was
seemingly no unpleasantness between them,
for they talked together a great deal that
evening, Avithout perceiving how intently
they were Avatched by the master of the
house.
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 106 -->

A couple of days later, M. de Moranges had
an interview wdth his sister touching the
matter of the deputation, on which she Avas so
intent. At its close,—


\"Adele," said he, " you knoAv I really do
like Olivier—I like to have him about me—he's
not bright, but he's safe, I have convinced
myself of that—thoroughly safe ! which is
saying a vast deal as times go. Now, I should
reproach myself if I did not give you a hint
that may be useful. Perhaps it would be Avise
to beware of Mile. Aspasie—you knoAv who
it is I allude to." The Dowager nodded
assent.


\"There is no danger in mere beauty for
Olivier," propounded the experienced Marquis,
—(oh! the vanity of all mere experience!)—
\"he has a surfeit of that at home; his Avife is
certainly the loveliest Avoman in Paris, but a
clever Avoman, a very clever Avoman, like Mile.
de Mourjonville, may be dangerous to him. I
shoAv my anxiety for the well-being of our  
  
  
  amily by speaking as I am now doing, for
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 107 -->
the loss of that woman Avould be a terrible
loss to me, a dislocation of my household
indeed; but if you agree Avith me in
thinkingthere may be danger, I will send her away
directly."


\"Not for worlds, Maurice ! not for Avorlds ! "
retorted his sister expressively. " I know
what the value of that kind of person must be
to you—in your peculiar circumstances—" and
she looked demurely doAvn; " and I would
not deprive you of her under any
consideration."


\"Remember ! I have warned you," continued
the Marquis. " But if you are sure there is no
danger—"  
  
  
  The Dowager smiled.  
  
  
  " None ! " she rejoined.


\"Olivier is not clever," opined her brother,
shaking his head.


\"No ! " retorted she; " and that will save
him. It is always your over-intelligent
imaginative men who get ensnared and carried away.
I have taken good care Olivier should have no
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 108 -->
  
  imagination; but thank you all the same, dear
Maurice."  
  
  
  
This Avas the new card Destiny had been
putting into Mile. Aspasie's hand Avithout her
guessing it.
<!-- Leaf 119 -->
  
  CHAPTER X.  
  
  
  THE CIRCULAR.


It was the middle of June, and the work of
re-election of a deputy to fill the place of the
defunct M. Carpentier Avas fixed to take place
in the second week in July. There was no
time to lose, for, although the government had
not put forth its candidate, there Avere one or
two men, as we already know, in the
department who might, by setting their shoulder
to the wheel, succeed in attracting to their
efforts the support of the entire administration,
namely both the central and the purely local.


\"You are perfectly sure of the bishop,
mother, are you not \" asked Olivier of the
Dowager, as they sat, some seven or eight
persons gathered together in conclave, in the
so-called library at Beauvoisin, convoked for
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 110 -->
the express purpose of deliberating upon the
circular the young Marquis Avas to address to
the electors.


\"Sure of the bishop ?" echoed the Dowager.
"Well! some people say one must never be
sure of any one, but I fancy we are sure
of the bishop; what do you say, Monsieur
Tarbet?" she added, turning to a little, fat,
bald-headed man, who sat at a table someAvhat
behind her chair, busily looking through his
spectacles at some account-books. He was
the family notary.


\"Whether Madame la Marquise can rely on
Monseigneur ?" questioned this individual,
shoving his spectacles doAvn to the extreme
edge of his nose, and looking over them; " I
think so, though there is a good deal to be
said; Monseigneur is a native of hereabouts."


\"I knew him vicaire, and aftenvards cure' of
Malleray," interrupted the Comte de Clavreuil,
who Avas present on this occasion, a fine, tall,
not intelligent-looking man of fifty, Avith all
the remains of that remarkable beauty which
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 111 -->
bloomed forth in the face of his youthful
daughter Claire. " I kneAv him," he continued,
\"a perfectly good royalist, a right thinker;
that was six-and-twenty years ago. My cousin
Jean, to whom ClaAreuil then belonged, took
an interest in him, and helped to get him
patronised by the then bishop, who gave him
the parish of Malleray. It was in the days of
Louis Philippe, and the French clergy thought
rightly then; our present bishop got this first
step of his OAving to the ardour of his legitimist
convictions, but he is, as M. Tarbet says, a
child of the soil, and has all his family in the
department."


\"All his family don't amount to much,"
rejoined the notary; "there's his aunt Piedefer,
who fives at St. Martin, and was a cook thirty
years back, and has saved money; and two
old spinsters still at Malleray, very poor, and
of whom he takes but little notice."  
  
  
  " And you forget the cure of—:


\"Belespoir," put in Henri Dupont, who had
promised not to leave Olivier till the affair of
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 112 -->
the elections was decided; "the man Avho in
the end Avill ahvays make the bishop do Avhat
he likes."


\"True," replied the notary, "I had forgotten
the cure' of Belespoir ! "


\"But I had not," observed the DoAvager,
Avith a quiet smile; " and I think Ave shall be
able to count upon him."


\"Take care of the Viviennes," suggested
Count Dupont. " Belespoir is the parish of
Mont-ViAdenne, and Vivienne's grand-uncle is
Archbishop of Chantilly."


\"I mean to give a set of bells complete,
and restore the belfry of Belespoir," said the
DoAvager, with considerable self-satisfaction.


"They can do more than that," pursued
Dupont. "Reflect that their archbishop is
close upon ninety. Noav, what the cure of
Belespoir is looking to, is a coadjutorship, and
then, everything else : the cardinal's hat, the
archbishopric of Lyons, Paris—everything in
short."  
  
  
  M. de Clavreuil turned upon his heel.
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 113 -->

"What a country!" he muttered; "in which
a shoemaker's apprentice can become Avhat
my father's uncle was proud to be." (A
Clavreuil had been Archbishop of Lyons before'89.)


\"And in which the son of a Corsican notary
can sit on the throne of St. Louis!" retorted
Henri Dupont, in the same key, but Avith a
look of sly jubilation lurking at the corner of
his eyes.


\"Not the same throne," said, hastily, M. de
ClaATeuil; " certainly not that."


\"Certainly not, M. le Comte," answered
Dupont, with mock gravity; " something
quite different: an inverted drum, if you like,
covered over Avith velvet torn from the
hangings of Versailles; but answering the same
purpose, all the same."


This was a parenthesis in the general
conversation.


\"Suppose Olivier were to read us the circular
he means to send out," suggested the
youngMarquise, Avho was seated at a window,
bending over an embroidery-frame.  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  I
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 114 -->

\"Have you got it there, mother ?" asked
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin, stretching out his handsome
figure lazily in his large arm-chair, and leaning
his handsome head more lazily still upon the
chair's back.


The Dowager laid her hand upon some loose
sheets of paper by her side.


"Well, mother dear," added, blandly, the
future legislator, " you Avrote it, so you may as
well read it."


\"Hush, hush !" interposed the DoAvager,
\"that is all very Avell, quite betAveen ourselves,
as Ave are at this moment, but, my dear
Olivier, if you enter on a political career,
you must really learn to have a little more
self-reliance."


("Who is to teach him this, Madame la
Marquise, I would beg of you to inform me 1"


I am not quite sure that a rapid glance of
Claire's beautiful eyes did not mutely convey
some such demand as the above, but it Avas
not noticed.)  
  
  
  The DoAvager took up the sheets of paper
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 115 -->
we have alluded to, and tendering them to the
notary,—


\"Read, Tarbet," said she; and that
functionary, seemingly honoured by the command,
settled his spectacles, put his left hand into
his waistcoat, and looked as if he thought
himself about to harangue some hundreds of
his attentive countrymen from the top of the
tribune:


"Electors of the department of
Savre-etMerle," began the little man, " it is as the
successor of a long line of ancestors, all
devoted to our common country, and to the
sacred cause of order, that I present myself to
you, and openly acknowledge the hope that
you will choose me as the champion of your
interests in the legislative chamber "


"Beg pardon, Madame la Marquise,"
interposed a well-to-do-looking personage, who had
tfll then been silent, "but they Avon's like that,
hereabouts; they'll say it's making too sure of
them."  
  
  
  " Well," rejoined the Dowager, rather huffily,  
  
  
  I 2
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 116 -->
\"the word hope appears to me happy, as not
implying the security which, of course, Ave
naturally feel."


\"Do you ? " mumbled the former speaker (it
was the medical practitioner of Malleray, a
man of enormous influence), shaking his head.
\"Do you ? I'm delighted to hear it; but you
have to deal Avith very queer people—people
who nourish the most extraordinary illusions
about their rights, and the Lord only knoAvs
Avhat all besides. If it goes against you to say
that you solicit the favour of their suffrages "
(M. de Ckwreuil bounded upon his chair),
"strike out, at all events, the open
acknoAvledgment of your hope; they won't like it:
I knoAv them. If you absolutely hold to hope,
qualify it by uncertainty; say you venture to
hope."


\"But, S—, doctor," broke in M. de
Ckivreuil, forgetting, in his indignation, everything
else so utterly as to swear, just as though he
were still amongst his comrades of the garde
du corps, " Wiat is the use of submitting to
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 117 -->
the empire if we are to curry favour Avith the
populace, as in the days of the red republic ?"


\"There is no reason Avhatever for submitting
to the empire, Monsieur le Comte," replied,
quietly, the doctor, taking a big pinch of snuff,
\"if you can help it. And excuse me if I say
that what you are pleased to term the red
republic, never has had any day at all; at
least, yet," he added, Avith a marked emphasis
(like a privileged person as he was).


\"No, but it will have very soon, indeed, if
all your Aollanous modern theories go on being
propagated."


\"Pardon, pardon," replied the doctor, " what
is it you and Ave all want ? Ave Avant our
excellent young Marquis here to be a deputy, and
you are all good enough to think that in some
portions of the department I can help his
election. Noav, if you are taken suddenly ill and
send for me, you have the condescension''
(there was a slight touch of irony there that
made Henri Dupont hide a smile by bending
down over the table), " the extreme
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 118 -->
condescension, let me say, to folloAv the advice I give.
You take my remedies, and ha\re done so now
for twenty years : but if I am to help you in
this new sphere, you must follow my advice
here too. I know these people; you don't.
They don't like you as it is, which Avon's
prevent them from electing a deputy from
amongst you, because there are others they
like still less. They don't like you, and, if you
don't know Iioav to manage them, they'll avoAV
then dislike."


\"But surely, my dear Robichon, avc pay
court to them enough !" exclaimed, bitterly,
the DoAvager.


\"In many respects, a vast deal too much;
and far more than is needed," rejoined M.
Robichon. " But you invariably fail in all
your attempts to make them think you don't
Avish them at the bottom of the sea. It is the
way of doing it, that you have not got,
somehow."


\"Perhaps the evil is incurable ? " suggested
Henri Dupont.
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 119 -->

\"Perhaps it is," responded, sloAvly and
gravely, the doctor; and then reverting
suddenly to his former half-bantering tone : " I
don't like to think any eAdl incurable, young
man," said he; "it ain't in my nature. When
I got Mademoiselle Claire, yonder,—I beg her
pardon, Madame la Marquise!—when I got her
out of her typhus fever, ten years ago, I didn't
do it by thinking her incurable."


\"Dear papa-doctor," murmured the young
Marquise, Avith one of her sweetest looks
directed full at the old man's face. "You
knoAv that was what I called you all the time."


\"Yes, and that's why I allowed myself to
speak my mind so entirely to you all—even to
you, Madame," he added, turning round
toAvards the Dowager, and bowing. " You are
folloAving the old traditions of your class,
Avhich have always brought you to grief. You
will persist in fancying that everything that
occurs is in some way meant by ProAddence for
your especial benefit: there is the mistake.
You fancy the empire is made for you; now,
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 120 -->
the empire is made for the emperor first, and
next, for a set of people with Avhom you have
nothing in common. Then you fancy that the
so-called masses must be charmed to see
themselves represented by the illustrious names of
ancient France; Avhereas, they are absolutely
ignorant of ancient France; and Avhere not
ignorant, hostile."


\"AIIoav me to differ totally from you, my
dear friend," exclaimed the notary, Avho had
still his left hand in his Avaistcoat, and wanted
to be delivered of his address. " AIIoav me to
differ totally from you. The people of France
have been blinded, ill taught, but they ask no
better than to be led back into the right
road."


\"WheAv ! " wdiistled the irreverent doctor;
\"that will take a deal longer time than Ave have
to give to the election before us. However,
try it."


\"Meanwhile," interrupted the DoAvager, who
thoroughly Avell knew old Robichon's influence
throughout the entire department, " suppose
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 121 -->
Ave modify the first phrase, and say we venture
to hope."


{empty}M. de ClaATeuil protested by indistinct
grumblings.  
  
  
  " Read on, Tarbet," continued the DoAvager.


"—The sacred cause of order," proceeded
the notary, " is the common cause of all
Frenchmen; and that cause can never be
surely upheld, fought for, victoriously
maintained, save by the time-honoured possessors of
the soil, by the long-descended families whose
names are identical with "


\"The devil! " cried out the doctor, jumping
up from his seat. " Do you seriously believe
that I, or any other reasonable being, can do
any good with a circular of that kind ? No,
thank you, I'll go home, and look after my
patients, and not mix myself up in any such
ineAdtable mess."


Much to the disgust of all present, the
youngMarquise was leaning back in her chair,
indulging in a fit of irrepressible laughter at old
Robichon's outbreak, and in this was joined by
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 122 -->
Count Dupont, who, Avhen the first vehemence
of the doctor Avas a little calmed, ventured
to hint that the constituted authorities
themselves would rebel against the tone of Olivier's
circular.


\"From the prefects doAvn to the very
gamekeepers, you Avould have them all up in arms,"
said he; " they lay claim to be the only
guardians of order."

a


"And the clergy 1" retorted Robichon; " do
you suppose you could be sure of them \ Why,
they'll ahvays betray even the
throne-and-thealtar party for the administration of the hour,
because that said administration has more in
its gift than anybody else."


\"If the clergy did not support us,"
ejaculated M. de Clavreuil, dramatically, " they
Avould be false to their faith, as Avas St. Peter."


\"For AA'hich he was forgiven," muttered
Olivier (very bright for him !).


\"M. le Comte, M. le Comte ! " roared out
old Robichon; " since when is the legitimist
party identical Avith God Almighty ? "
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 123 -->

\"What is that noise ?" asked the Dowager,
as a great commotion was heard outside;
voices, wheels, doors opening and shutting,
and steps resounding along passages. " Ring
the bell, Tarbet, and see what it all means."


But the man of deeds and documents had no
time. The door from the vestibule into the
billiard-room and through to the library opened,
and the Marquis de Moranges entered.


\"Thank heavens it is you, Maurice," cried
his sister; "we are all at sixes and sevens
here, but you Avill set us right at once."


"I've nothing particularly pleasant to tell
you," remarked M. de Moranges, Avith a smile,
and exchanging very affectionate greetings
with his lovely niece. " I've driven over from
Brunoy as fast as possible to inform you that
the government is going to put forth a
candidate, and that candidate is "


\"Who ?" burst from all voices at once,
even from the soft tones of the young
Marquise.  
  
  
  "As if the quickest way to know was to
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 124 -->
interrupt one," said, contemptuously, M. de
Moranges. " So like Avomen, that; and, faith !
men too :" and he shrugged his shoulders.
"Well, then, the government candidate is
going to be Vivienne ! "  
  
  
  " Impossible! "  
  
  
  " It's a joke ! "  
  
  
  " Well played ! "  
  
  
  " A hidden trump !"
\"It can't be ! "  
  
  
  " I always feared it!"


These Avere a feAv of the tumultuous
expressions that ensued.  
  
  
  " What, Gaston ?" demanded the DoAvager.
\"No," retorted her brother, " the Dukehimself."  
  
  
  " The Duke ?" thundered M. de Clavreuil.


\"Isn't he sufficiently deAroted to the sacred
cause of order, M. le Comte ? " inquired,
ironically, old Robichon.


\"By thunder, Avhat a piece of treachery ! "
Avas the furious reply he got.  
  
  
  " The bishop's at the bottom of it all," opined
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 125 -->
{empty}M. Tarbet, rubbing his bald croAvn, wdiich had
become hot.


\"I thought you were quite sure of the
bishop, mother," urged, reproachfully, Olivier.


\"Stuff about the bishop," retorted M. de
Moranges; " it's the cure of Belespoir has done
it all, with the prefect."


Henri Dupont stopped in the lounge he had
been taking up and doAvn the library while the
talk was hottest.


\"Oh," said he, pursing up his lips, and
laying one hand on Olivier's shoulder, " the cure
of Belespoir, is it ? Well, then, never mind,
old fellow; what is done may be undone yet."
<!-- Leaf 136 -->
  
  CHAPTER XL  
  
  
  GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES.


The neAvs M. de Moranges had brought Avas
an ordinary occurrence enough. Until the
hour when the government, having definitively
chosen its candidate, announces him in the
Moniteur, and instructs its provincial
delegates, the prefects, sub-prefects, and mayors, to
announce the said individual as the official
candidate, until that hour, the declaration of
such or such a person having secured the
government support and patronage is one of
the most approved manœuvres for or against
those Avho have presented themselves as
independent,


Noav the department of Savre-et-Merle was
not one touching which the government had
any pre-conceived design; and, for anything
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 127 -->
which had yet been determined, the election
would turn on the merely local influences of
prefects, sub-prefects, and landowners.


At the eastern extremity of the department
stood Combeville, the post toAvn of Ckvreufl,
and where M. de Clavxeuil Avould, had he cared
for it, have reigned, but he did not care for it.
{empty}M. de Moranges, as we know, put it othenvise,
and was wont to employ the formula, "
Clavreuil is a fool! " upon all occasions. The
subprefect of Combeville therefore had not much
to fear from the ClaATreuil faction.


At Malleray, as we know, the mightiest
influence was Beauvoisin's, and that influence
had become incarnate in the Dowager. But
this was recent.


Four or five years ago the real influence in
the Avhole department had been vested in the
person of Count Dupont de Laporte, the father
of Olivier's friend Henri, and proprietor of the
fine domain of Breuvieres, Avhich lay to the
north-west, behind Beauvoisin, obliquely
towards Mont-Vivienne, and was important
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 128 -->
equally to Malleray and Brunoy both. He
had been four years dead.


His son had done nothing to perpetuate the
paternal influence, for, having spent his early
youth in times subsequent to those which had
tempered the mettle of his father's nature,
and made political strife his element, Henri
Dupont looked at what Avent on from afar, and
rather more as a philosopher than as a
politician. He had been a great traveller, having
lived in the East for three years (eight years
ago), and Adsited India on his father's death
(Avhich Avas a severe sorrow to him), and spent
a twelvemonth in America at the period of
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin's marriage and journey to
Italy.


Henri Dupont had seen too much of the
Avorld at large to be able to take delight in the
steeple-interests of a department, wherein the
first booby, or the first rogue who Avins official
favour, may lord it over the grandest intellect
and noblest character in the whole nation. He
really loved his country, believed in her,
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 129 -->
abstained from action, watched, and hoped.
Vulgar observers set down Henri Dupont as
an Orleanist. He was nothing. It might be,
perhaps, nearer the truth to describe him as
Avhat alone a Frenchman can be who despairs
not of France : namely, a republican.


The fortune of the Duponts was very large,
and identified Avith more than one force in the
nation. In SaA^e-et-Merle they possessed two
considerable estates, stretching over almost
the Avhole distance between Malleray and
Mont-Vivienne; in Normandy they were
extensive proprietors, as also in the environs of
Paris; and in railway property old Dupont had
been one of the earliest and largest holders.
Henri Dupont was famous as an agriculturist
and cattle-breeder, and carried off prizes
Avithout end, and wherever his name was mentioned
it was so with respect for the exceeding
uprightness and loyalty of his character. Between
his father and the Dowager there had been a
life-long friendship in spite of all political
differences, for they were neighbours, widoAved  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  K
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 130 -->
early both of them (it had been said even that
they would end by marrying), and from Count
Dupont the Dowager Marquise consented to
accept advice.


At Mont-Vivienne, too, Henri Dupont Avas
ever a welcome guest, and at Brunoy : Avhereas
at Clavxeuil he was ignored. The political
feeling there was of a species that eschewed
compromise, and once only in his life had
Olivier's best friend been received by the
parents of Olivier's future Avife. This Avas a
few days previous to Henri's departure for
America, and just after the first preliminaries
of the marriage treaty had been opened
between the realms of Clavreuil and
Beauvoisin. He had ridden over to Clavreuil one
day in December, and been presented to the
Countess by Olivier, but he barely caught
sight of Claire, Avhom her mother managed to
exile from the drawing-room. When the visit
was over, and the tAvo young men Avere
preparing in the stable-yard for a hard ride back
to Beauvoisin, so as not to keep the Dowager's
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 131 -->
dinner waiting, a singular Adsion, as we know,
crossed their path. On Olivier's mind it left
no impress : Henri Dupont never forgot the
face he then saw, and the strange beauty of
the hungry girl was instantly recalled to his
memory the moment he found himself, fifteen
months later, face to face Avith the
universallyadmired Sphinx.


Henri Dupont was not actively an influence
in Savre-et-Merle; but it was, at the same
time, an article of faith everywhere that, if he
chose, the government would do anything in
the world to win him over: as yet, he had not
chosen. His acquaintance Avith the prefect
was of the most purely negative kind; and, as
to the sub-prefects, he passed them over Avith
polite disdain.


Now, how stood it with M. de Moranges ?
He wras, in fact, not of the department. The
Moranges were settled in Auvergne for the
last five centuries (their origin was Burgundian,
before the first Crusade, but they had migrated),
and the Brunoy property had been bought  
  
  
  K 2
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 132 -->
during the restoration by Maurice de
Moranges' mother. The dominion exercised,
hoAvever, by the Marquis over his surroundings
was an undeniable one; and, had he
presented himself as a candidate, he would have
carried the entire department Avith him:
nothing could have resisted him. But this was
a purely personal influence, and rested on
social supremacy, and Parisian repute.


At Mont-Vivienne, which occupied the whole
north-western extremity of the province, Avas a
stronghold of Avhat might easily have been—
but never Avas—independent authority. The
Due de Vivienne, a hale sportsman (and little
else) of sixty, was in the enjoyment of
something like tweh^e hundred thousand francs
(nigh on fifty thousand pounds sterling) a-year;
yet his usual predominance in the county was
utterly disproportioned to such resources as
his fortune supposed. The Viviennes had no
political opinions whatever. They patronised
legitimism, because that Avas the proper thing
to do; but they were, in reality, only clerical.
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 133 -->
Out of the temporal power of the Pope, and
the subjection of every other power in France
to the jurisdiction of bishops, they cared for
nothing. They were instruments in the hands
of any member of the clergy who should take
the trouble to play upon them.


There was in their near neighbourhood just
such a member of the clergy as this. No
sooner had the neAvs arrived of M. Carpentier's
illness, than the cure of Belespoir had resolved
on becoming coadjutor of Chantilly. No
sooner Avas the breath fairly out of M.
Carpentier's body, than all his attacking forces
were in the field, but called up so quietly, that
no one Avas a bit the wiser.


The cure of Belespoir was the bishop's
nepheAv; and the bishop was a sworn ally of
the Dowager. But the thing was to be
managed quite differently; the Due de
Vivienne was to be transformed into a government
candidate (not quite identical Avith an official
one), the prefect was to support him through
thick and thin, and all imaginable lesser
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 134 -->
intrigues of sub-prefects, or any subordinates
whatever, were to be trampled upon.


The cure of Belespoir triumphed completely.
He secured his candidate, and the government
support; and the news brought by M. de
Moranges was very near being the truth; but
the curd of Belespoir had overlooked one or
two extremely small points of detail, as will
sometimes happen with ambitious schemers
on a grand scale; and these almost invisible
points lay at the root of Avhat grew to be
disappointment and failure.


What the^ cure of Belespoir had overlooked
we shall see later.
<!-- Leaf 145 -->
  
  CHAPTER XII.  
  
  
  TWO TO ONE ON THE BLACK.


The cure of Belespoir had acted, as ambitious
churchmen often do, without sufficiently taking
into account the forces that would be opposed
to him. "When he had persuaded the prefect
and detached his uncle the bishop from the
Beauvoisin party he regarded Adctory as certain,
and overlooked Avhat he would have styled
insignificant opponents. Now, of these
opposing forces tAvo were incarnate in human
bodies, and had name on the one side, Henri
Dupont de Laporte, on the other, Marius
Daudel, the sub-prefect of Malleray; and
besides these two tangible obstacles there was
the anonymous and incoherent force, yclept
the chapter of accidents, which has so much
to say in the crises of human life ! All
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 136 -->
these the haughty churchman scornfully
overlooked.


And noAV he resolved to embark upon an
enterprise somewThat more difficult than that
of persuading the Due de Vivienne to put
forth his candidature for the deputation; upon
that namely of inducing the DoAvager of
Beauvoisin to AvithdraAV hers.


A few days after the meeting for the
drawling up of Olivier's circular, the cure of
Belespoir made a visit to Beauvoisin. It Avas a
beautiful day; breakfast Avas just over, and
in the drawing-room, into Avhich the ecclesiastic
Avas ushered, the two Marchionesses Avere
seated, whilst Olivier made believe to read the
neAvspapers just brought in by the post. The
DoAvager was busy with the perpetual Avhite
wools, Claire Avas playing with her child, who
lay rolling on a Turkey carpet spread out for
him on the floor, whilst a tall, handsome
Avoman watched at a little distance,
respectfully, the infant pleasures of her nursling.
The sun came in, softened through the thick
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 137 -->
foliage of a clump of trees, right in front of
the window opening upon what might have
been an English lawn.


When the first greetings were over, the
cure, having seemingly made up his mind that
boldness was the only policy, broached the
subject of the elections with an appearance
of frankness that was not without a certain
charm. He was a handsome man, that cure
of Belespoir, Avith graceful gestures, an
agreeable voice, and good manners, and he thought
himself certain in the long run of doing what
he liked, even with the Dowager Marquise; so
he made a speech about the necessity of union
in the party (!) and the dangers of the church,
and the duty of sacrificing everything to
the defence of the temporal poAver of the
Pope.


\"I am thoroughly of your opinion," said
the Dowager, " and, when our circular appears,
you will, I think, be satisfied Avith it."


\"It has not yet appeared ?" interposed the
cure, blandly.
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 138 -->

"We expect it to come home from the
printer's to-night," added Olivier.


"Madame la Marquise," recommenced the
churchman, after a pause of a few seconds, and
as though he had resolved upon the
accomplishment of a difficult task, " let me appeal to
your strong, nay, almost masculine sense of
patriotism—to your well-knoAvn political
convictions, and, above all, to the fervour of your
Christian zeal. It is a sacrifice I come to ask,
and that is Avhy I ask it. No one has for years
done more good to our sacred cause than you
have; do not imperil that good by an
illadvised act" (the Dowager knitted her black
brows)—" by an act that Avill neutralise all
our long-persistent efforts—do not divide this
already much divided province—do not weaken
the defenders of our holy religion—do not give
our enemies the spectacle of our
dissensionsdo not contest the election of the department
Avith the Due de Vivienne."


The Dowager laid down her avooIs, and
compressing her thin lips looked the cure
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 139 -->
through and through Avith her sharp black
eyes; but, compressed as were the lips, and
sharp as were the eyes, he thought he detected
behind all these an imperceptibly wavering
purpose.


He was preparing to follow up his
arguments, when his design was opposed from a
quarter he had not yet taken much notice of;
Claire, leaving her boy to his nurse, had come
forward and was leaning one hand upon the
table in front of the cure.


\"I beg your pardon, M. l'Abbe," said she,
in a sweet, clear voice, " there is no difference
in the religious convictions of the two
candidates; you may rely upon M. de Beauvoisin's
Christian zeal as thoroughly as upon that of
{empty}M. de Vivienne; but there is a question of
engagements taken, of responsibilities accepted
and incurred, of friends compromised—a
question, in short, of honour, and my husband
cannot recede from the contest—it is too late."


\"Bravo, Claire, bravo ! " exclaimed Olivier,
with unprecedented energy, and throAving away
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 140 -->
his newspaper : " bravo ! that's just what it is,
and you're quite right."


The situation Avas a thoroughly altered one,
and one for Avhich no one present was
prepared.


The Dowager would noAv, in her inmost
soul, have gladly given the whole thing up,
for she did not care to see suddenly arise
before her this new spirit in her
daughterin-law, this spirit Avhich she had only vaguely
guessed at, AAdien she warned Madame de
Clavreuil of the possible difficulty of
managingClaire.


In Claire a sudden feeling had burst forth;
the revolt of a high-minded upright
gentleAvoman against the petty arts of an intriguer.
Perhaps the old teachings of Mrs. Griffiths
prompted her, but she determined that, the
first time in his life Avhen her husband was
about to take a step in public life, he should
take it courageously and not flinch from the
Avord he had once given. Her son's father
should behave like a gentleman; and all the
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 141 -->
knightly blood of the old narrow-minded,
unintellectual, but immaculately honourable
Clavreuils, boiled over within her, and she did
what was to be done.


As Claire stood upright there between those
three, draped in her white robes, quivering
Avith the strong Adbration of the honest purpose
within her, glowing Avith the flush of beauty
her sudden energy lent her, she Avas an object
of amaze to all.


The Dowager Avas amazed and hated her;
the cure was amazed, and feared her; Olivier
was amazed and thunderstruck by his wife's
loveliness.


(It was not then too late for this ill-joined
pair—but it was not to be !)


Claire was alone against her adversaries,
but she had the best of it notAvithstanding,
and they felt this, though she was not so sure.


When help came to her from Olivier she was
glad, very glad.


\"I have but spoken in your name," said
she, turning to Olivier with a look of
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 142 -->
unconscious but irresistible sovereignty; " but I
have spoken your thoughts, have I not ?"


\"Every Avord my wife has said is exactly
what I feel, and I will act up to every Avord
of Claire's," rejoined Olivier, Avith a Advacity
quite unusual; nor was he Avanting in dignity
as he spoke. When he had spoken, he came
towards his AAdfe, took her hand and kissed
it, looking at her in a manner that made
her blush deeply and lower her eyes to the
ground.


The cure Avas vanquished, and, man of the
world as he was, he gave a graceful air to his
defeat, and Avhen after discoursing upon other
subjects he took his leave, declining to stay to
dinner, he parted from all his opponents in
apparently undisturbed friendship.


It was evident the curd had overlooked the
young Marquise in his calculations. HoAvever,
it Avas a fight iioav, and would have to be
fought; so he must nerve the prefect for the
contest.  
  
  
  As he left Beauvoisin he inquired from the
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 143 -->
footman who opened the carriage door for him,
whether Count Dupont de Laporte was still
staying at the chateau, or whether he had
returned to Breuvieres \


\"He left suddenly for Paris several days
ago," was the reply.


\"Oh ! " That was all the cure of Belespoir
remarked; but he said it again to himself as
he was rolling along on the road, and it was
a meditative long draAvn out " Oh."


When the cure of Belespoir left Beauvoisin,
he gave orders to the driver of the hired
vehicle in which he had come there, to drive
back home, namely, to Belespoir, Avhich lay
not far from Brunoy. Anybody might have
heard him give this order. But, Avhen he had
passed the park-gates and emerged upon the
road, he stopped the carriage, and told the
coachman to turn his horse's head round, and
drive to Malleray.


Half-an-hour later the stately churchman,
who had caused himself to be set down at the
door of the cure of Malleray might be seen,
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 144 -->
wending his way on foot toAvards the
subprefecture. The sub-prefect was not at home,
but the conseiller de prefecture Avas, and Avith
this young aspirant for administrative honours
the cure had rather a long, and we Avill
therefore hope, a useful conversation. It was late
in the afternoon Avhen the cure' fairly set out
on his home journey toAvards Belespoir, and
the last place where he had called in Malleray,
Avas at the sub-prefectorial printing-office. He
staid there for about a quarter of an horn',
closeted Avith the director of the establishment,
and about an hour after he had left, the
conseiller de prefecture also paid a visit to the
said director and held private converse Avith
him.


The subject of their interview seemed to
have been a pleasant one, for Avhen they
separated both appeared internally amused by
some happy fancy.


\"It is the story of the oyster over again !"
said the printing-office director, as he parted
from his visitor; " each of these clericals will
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 145 -->
get a shell, but we must mind that we get the
oyster!" And both men chuckled as they
shook hands.


We should like the reader to have a precise
notion of the time that had been required for
the events we have related in the last two or
three chapters.


It was the third Aveek in June when the
Dow*ager marshalled her household troops
down to Beauvoisin, and prevailed upon her
brother to spend a short time at Brunoy in his
nephew's interest. She believed Olivier would
in reality wralk over the course; the Due de
Vivienne nourished exactly the same belief as
regarded his OAvn candidature, and this is.
easily explained by the un-importance
attached by the government to the election. M
de Laprunaey had not come forAvard, no one
quite knew wherefore, and Achille BouAder,
the attorney's son at CombeArille, had been
held back, no one quite kneAv by whom. He
had been for a long while held to be the one
serious candidate; therefore, he not presenting  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  L
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 146 -->
himself, the course seemed tolerably clear.
The government Avas indifferent, the prefect
slow; each aspirant kept his own counsel, and
thought he could rely on the same supporters
whereof his rival felt also sure—so that, till
their antagonism was declared, the antagonists
went to Avork, each for himself, and full of
hopeful illusions.


It was on a Tuesday that had been held at
Beauvoisin the gathering we have described
for the purpose of draAving up Olivier's circular.
On the Wednesday this document was carried
to the printing-office by Henri Dupont de
Laporte, who left Beauvoisin that day not long
after daAvn, and passed through Malleray,
having to gain Chartres in time for the
uptrain to Paris, Avhither he had suddenly
decided to go. He had, as Ave have said, very
large estates in the neighbourhood of Paris,
and there was nothing extraordinary in the
fact of his presence being required on matters
of private business.  
  
  
  But a week had gone by and not only Count
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 147 -->
Dupont had not returned, and had not Avritten
to anyone since he left, but it was impossible
for the people at Beauvoisin to get the printed
copies of Olivier's circular. It was on the
Wednesday that the cure of Belespoir had paid
his visit to the chateau, and, as we know, the
circular was not yet out, but positively
expected for that very evening—when it did not
come.


Delivered over to the printer on the
Wednesday, it had been promised for the Saturday,
then deferred till the Tuesday (Sunday and
Monday being no days); then it was faithfully
promised for the Wednesday, and then, on
an impatient demand sent on the Thursday
morning by the Marquis de Beauvoisin, the
answer made was that such an unusual stress
of business had been laid on the workmen by
the voluminous reports unexpectedly sent in
from the Conseil d'Arrondissement and
Municipal Council (concerning financial matters)
that it had been impossible to execute private
orders; a delay of a few days was besought.  
  
  
  L 2
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 148 -->
It Avas no use being angry or impatient, it
must be borne.


There was no circular out from
MontVivienne either, for the cure of Belespoir, once
aware of the Beauvoisin candidature, hoped to
neutralise it, as Ave knoAv, and did not Avish,
if possible, to have to avow any dissension in
the Conservative party.


When he had seen, however, Avhat was
likely to be the resistance opposed by the rival
candidate, and Avhen he had overcome the first
surprise caused in him by the energy and
decision so suddenly shoAvn by the
youngMarquise, the curd became aAvare of the
necessity of publishing Avithout any delay the
address of the Due de Vivienne to the electors.
Needless to say that this profession of faith
was entirely composed by the Curate-Dean
himself.


Early in the morning of the day but one
after the curd's visit to Beauvoisin, this
document was also deposited in the hands of the
director of the sub-prefectorial printing-office
<!-- Leaf 159 -->
  
  TWO TO ONE ON THE BLACK. 1.9
at Malleray, and a verbal assurance was
confidentially given by that functionary to the
bearer, that the copies for distribution should
be ready within forty-eight hours.

  CHAPTER XIII.  
  
  
  THE POSTMASTER OF MALLERAY.


\"Those aristocrats and clericals have it all
their oavu way, as usual. I always kneAV it
Avould be so, and so I told Thdophile Avhen
the coup d'etat took place, only he wouldn't
believe it."


This speech was made by old Mardonnet,
the postmaster at Malleray, in the afternoon
of the very day Avhen the Mont-Vivienne
circular was lodged in the hands of the
printingoffice director. The latter Avas a chum of old
Mardonnet's, had been so for more than a
quarter of a century, and but a feAV months
ago had owed a great service to the postmaster,
obtained through his active intercession Avith
the Minister of, Avho, as we remember,
was cousin to Mardonnet's deceased wife.
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 151 -->

The old postmaster had breakfasted at the
printing-office that morning, and knew all
about the new circular from Mont-Vivienne,
and the old one from Beauvoisin, and was in
his own mind thoroughly convinced that the
electoral contest for Savre-et-Merle Avould be
waged between the two great landed
proprietors of the district, and that it did not
much matter which of the tAvo won.


\"Except, indeed," as he remarked, " that
the Due de Vivienne was too priest-ridden and
might be for restoring tithes."


Old Mardonnet was, upon the occasion in
question, seated in his bureau, sorting the
letters and newspapers, and other parcels that
had just come in not a quarter of an hour ago.
The one bag, not a very big one either, lay on
a stool beside him, and he, seated on another,
extracted missive after missive and placed
them in their proper order and place on a
huge table before him. An elderly woman sat
in a chair by the window, sewing—it was his
sister-in-law, a widow, who had lived Avith
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 152 -->
him for the last ten years, and, like her defunct
sister, enjoyed the honour of being first cousin
to a minister. It Avas horribly stuffy in that
bureau, for it was a habit of old Mardonnet's
to keep the AvindoAV shut Avhile he sorted his
bag Why he did so nobody kneAv, but he
would do it, and, as I said, the place was
awfully hot and stuffy.


\"Yes," he resumed, harking back to his first
words; " those great people have it more than
ever their own Avay. I told Thdophile so, but
he would have it just the contrary, and hoav he
sees pretty well Avhat it comes to !"


\"Who knows," rejoined the elderly
seamstress," (by name Madame Hdloise Picard);
"who knoAvs Avhether he sees it or not ? people
don't always see Avhat is there to be seen, but
what they think they see. Thdophile had
always Avrong notions about everything."


\"Well," retorted the postmaster, " he Avas
cock-sure of becoming our deputy the moment
Carpentier should, in any way, be removed;
he can hardly fancy he has any chance now!
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 153 -->
(Two, three, five, six—six letters for
Beauvoisin,)" he muttered, parenthetically; " he
can hardly fancy he's got a chance, I should
think; there's Carpentier removed for ever by
death, yet, who ever thought for a moment of
Thdophile; he counted on his friend Dandel,
the sub-prefect, (such a ne'er-do-weel,) and he
counted on your grand cousin up yonder."


"On Lolo!" exclaimed Madame Picard (it
was a custom among his near relations
irreverently to call the great man thus, his name
being Louis). " On Lolo, forsooth ! as if he
ever did anything for anybody but himself!"
and she shrugged her shoulders.


\"Well, neATer mind," went on the
postmaster. "Thdophile persisted in believing in
him, too, and now he sees how it all is. No
sooner did Carpentier have that fit of his than
(my belief is) the prefect settled everything
with that Monseigneur at Belespoir, and no
sooner was the breath out of Carpentier's body
than Madame la Marquise comes down on all
our heads! And there they are now, both of
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 154 -->
them; they think nobody knows anything
about their quarrels, but everybody knows
all about it—it's Punch's secret! Beauvoisin
against Vivienne; a fight inside the same
camp, the old story over again ! There are
four letters for Clavreuil, and a Revue des
Deux Mondes for Breuvieres, and there's a
Moniteur for you, Hdloise," and he jerked the
paper toAvards his sister-in-laAv, upon whose
skirts it fell.


She had seemingly not much interest in it,
for she let it lie where it had dropped.


\"And the very instant it Avas seen Avho were
likely to be the candidates, Avhat did the
subprefect here do ? Avhy, get out of the Avay!
He used to be mighty civil to me, and was
constantly coming in to have a chat, (so
condescending !) but after Carpentier's death he
was sent for by the prefect, and Avhenever I've
met him since then he's skulked away and
avoided seeing me, and the moment the
Vivienne candidature came to be talked about
seriously, off he Avent, Heaven knoAvs where!
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 155 -->
a good friend, truly ! Mr. Marius Daudel! a
tower of strength ! a fine protector ! as
Thdophile thought him! just a blusterer made of
India-rubber!—well! I never saw a Red
Republican who was not so. Pah ! I hate
the whole lot of them."


\"I don't believe they're half as bad as
Republicans turned lacqueys," retorted Madame
Picard; "like Lolo," she added, sneeringly; "a
bully to those who look up, and a boot-blacker
to those who look doAvn upon 'em. Like
Lolo!" she added, for the second time, and
Avith apparently considerable satisfaction.


\"Bless my soul! what's this 1" ejaculated all
at once old Mardonnet: " Here's a letter from
Thdophile," and he adjusted his spectacles,
opened the envelope, and read.


The missive was a short one, three or four
lines only; but the Avrinkled face of the old
postmaster reddened with pleasure as he
scanned them. "Well, to be sure, this is
news !" he cried out. " He's got the cross,
Hdloise, fancy that!"
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 156 -->
  
  " Who has "


\"Why, Thdophile, to be sure ! " replied old
Mardonnet.


\"The cross ! " echoed Madame Picard, " and
for what, I should like to knoAv ?"


\"That he doesn't say," ansAvered her
brotherin-law, looking puzzled; " but here is Avhat he
does say:—  
  
  
  " My Dear Father,

\"I am happy to tell you that I have
had the honour of receiving the decoration the
day before yesterday, OAving to the
intervention of our cousin, the minister. I send
the Moniteur, containing the announcement
thereof to my aunt, and am your  
  
  
  " Very devoted son,  
  
  
  " Theophile Mardonnet."


\"There's his letter," said the postmaster
Avhen he had read that epistle, " and Heloise,
there's the Moniteur on your goAvn."  
  
  
  Madame Picard stooped uoav, and picked up
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 157 -->
the paper; opened it, and glanced down its
columns.


\"It's in the official part," observed
Mardonnet; "if you can't find it, give it me."


\"Here it is," said she, and she read the
statement of hoAv his Majesty the Emperor had
been pleased, on the proposal of the Minister
of, to decorate M. Thdophile Mardonnet,
Manager (he was only cashier) of the
International Franco-Italo-Daco-Roumanian
Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Roumania,
at Bucharest.


\"That is to prevent him for ever asking
for anything else," remarked Madame Picard.
"They give him the cross because they either
can't or won't make a deputy of him."


\"Very likely," responded old Mardonnet;
\"but it's very pretty of Lolo, all the same !
very nice, indeed !—is that all ? " he added,
turning to his sister-in-laAv, as though he half
expected his son to have been decorated several
times over; " is there nothing else in the
paper 1—nothing of any interest V
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 158 -->

"Nothing of any interest to us," replied
Madame Picard : " there's a long account of a
reception at the Tuileries, of the King of
Mesopotamia, and a report on the Chassepot
rifles, and three columns on Egyptianmummies, and then promotions in the army and

navy."  
  
  
  " Nobody we know anything of?"


\"Not a soul; and then here, there's an
account of the funeral of the Bishop of
Pontoise, and the nomination of the Bishop of St.
Germain, as coadjutor to the Archbishop of
Chantilly."


\"Ah ! no interest whatever in all that,"
muttered the old postmaster, as he turned once
more to his work of sorting the contents of his
bag.
<!-- Leaf 169 -->
  
  CHAPTER XIV  
  
  
  TEN TO ONE ON THE RED.


There was an alteration in Claire's manner
towards her husband since the day when he
had supported her and held his oavq ground
against the cure de Belespoir. It was so slight,
that, to most people, it would have been
imperceptible; but Olivier felt it, and it was
pleasant (in his homely phraseology he would
probably have said comfortable,) to him to be
in his Avife's company, nay, even to be alone
with her.


This was something altogether new, for,
from the very time of their marriage and
journey to Italy, though the best possible
understanding seemed to exist between them,
and though the youthful Marquise had
apparently no Avill save that of her lord, it was
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 160 -->
eAddent that their accordance rested on no
deeper foundation than that of good education
and good manners. Since their return to
Paris, this state of things had in no degree
improved, but just the reverse. M. de
Beauvoisin, as Ave knoAv, had little or nothing in
common Avith his wife, and their daily
employments brought them together only in public,
Avhere they manifested towards each other the
same invariable politeness. The even tenor of
their domestic serenity was the result of good
breeding—nothing beyond.


\"They knoAv hoAv to live," used to say the
Marquis de Moranges; " and that is the one
only indispensable science," he Avas Avont to
add.


Till the day on Avhich the curd of Belespoir
paid his eventful visit to the chateau, Olivier
had continued to be more or less embarrassed
by his wife's presence, and to avoid being with
her unless summoned by other persons. Let
no one fancy that this resulted from his
entanglement Avith Claudine; it had absolutely
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 161 -->
no connection Avith it. He knew that, as far
as the Sphinx was concerned, he was, as he
had practically described it, "in for it," and
this was agreeable enough so long as the
Sphinx and he were together; but, once
separated from the object of what, by ordinary
spectators, would have been termed his passion,
he thought no more of her.


I repeat it, Claire embarrassed him—made
him uneasy; and, spite of her undeviating
gentleness, impressed upon him a terrible sense
of inferiority. He did not like this—no man
does—and, as I say again, he avoided his
wife's presence.  
  
  
  This it was which w^as altered.


First and foremost, Claire's beauty had
suddenly struck him without overaAving or
freezing him. It was a genial impression which
her whole being made upon him Avhen she
stood up and took his part, associated him Avith
her, called him her husband, did not disdain
to proclaim herself one with him. It was
new, and it was delightful, and he could  
  
  
  11  
  
  
  VOL. II.
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 162 -->
not help hailing the occurrence with boyish
glee.


Claire, on her side, was more kindly
disposed towards the man who had so openly and
so unhesitatingly made common cause with her
—and that, not in the face of the curd alone,
but in the face also of the redoubtable
Marquise mother. She was touched by the ready
adhesion she had met with; there was
something simple and unsophisticated about the
obedience so warmly tendered, and Claire's
generous nature could not do otherwise than
overpay in gratitude any service accepted.


She was more than courteous—she was
familiar with her husband all the rest of the
day; and the next morning allowed him to
drive her over to Clavreuil in the pony-basket.
The Dowager could not make it out, but her
instinct warned her that her supremacy was
threatened.


Olivier felt at home with his wife, for they
had something to talk of which interested both.
Claire's interest in her husband's election was
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 163 -->
a lively one, for she Avas resolved to bring up
her son to play an active part in the affairs of
his country; and the first indispensable step
toAvards this, in her opinion, Avas the entrance
of the father into the arena of public life.


Claire loved France ardently, and loved the
traditions of the past, not narrowly, but
because, to her mind, the past Avas full of the
chivalrous, disinterested glories of her race
and of her land. Claire Avas no politician, but,
like every true French gentlewoman, loved
dearly whatever related to politics in the
abstract, and was, instinctively, at her ease in all
the combinations of la grande politique.


Olivier had no such impulses or aims as hers,
but he entered into the excitement of the
impending contest in a sportsman-like kind of
way, and, besides, he thought it fitting that he,
as the head of the Beauvoisin famfly, should
represent the department.


They had, therefore, at last, a subject in
common, this ill-mated man and wife, and they
seemed likely to make something of it in the  
  
  
  M 2
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 164 -->
end, and talked of it freely and earnestly, and
had opinions and exchanged them.


The day but one after old Mardonnet had
received the neAvs of his son's decoration,
Claire proposed to her husband to Avalk across
the park to Malleray, and see what letters the
rural postman brought, for they were sure to
meet him on the Avay.


It was a splendid day, Avith a burning sun,
but Avith a breeze also, and their road lay
through shady woods, and Claire had all the
pedestrian capacities of her countrywomen.
She Avalked along with queenly steps under
the leafy boughs, playing with rather than
using her parasol, for a broad straAV hat
protected her head and face. On they Avent,
discoursing of the coming contest, and Olivier
thinking within himself that he had never seen
any woman half so beautiful as Claire.


At a turning in the wood they heard the
sound of a horse's hoofs at no great distance.


"We're close to the cross-road that leads
from Beauvoisin to Clavreuil," said Olivier.
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 165 -->

The sound of the horse's hoofs ceased, and
then were heard closer, but with a deadened
sound.


\"How abominably ill one is served!"
exclaimed the Marquis; " that's some one
ridinginside our woods—making a thoroughfare of
Beauvoisin—the fellow's got on the turfy
paths, yet, God knows, I've keepers enough!
only they do nothing."


The sounds Avere distinct noAv, and came
nearer eveiy instant.


\"There is the intruder," observed Claire,
pointing with her parasol at a horseman
picking his way through the trees towards the very
path doAvn along which they were walking.


"Well, upon my life, that's cool!" ejaculated
angrily M. de Beauvoisin; " I'll tell him at
once that "


"Hallo, old felloAV ! is that you ? Avell
met!"  
  
  
  " Hoav delightful! it's Monsieur Dupont!"


These were the two exclamations which burst
simultaneously from the young Marquise and
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 166 -->
from Henri Dupont, for, sure enough, it was
he.


\"Well," said he, Avith a smile; " I meant
to surprise you, and it is you who surprise me,
starting suddenly out of the depths of a Avood
like goblins in a fairy tale," and, jumping from
his horse, he slung the rein over one arm, and
Avith the other linked himself to Olivier.


As they turned back, and Avalked on together
noAV, in the direction of the chateau, Henri
Dupont could not help surveying the pair
before him Avith a secret astonishment. He
was fairly puzzled. What had happened
during his absence ? There Avas not only good
intelligence between Olivier and Claire, there
was a cheerful familiarity that told of pleasant
intercourse, of home-habits; Henri couldn't
make it out. Was it possible that, to use M.
de Beauvoisin's oaati phrase, he and his Avifc
Avere beginning to get on together ?


\"Where have you come from ? " asked
Claire's sAveet ringing voice.  
  
  
  " From Paris, direct," Avas the reply.
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 167 -->

\"What's that nag ?" said Olivier, looking at
the big-boned animal that came slouching
behind, dragged by the rein upon Count
Dupont's arm.


\"That's the Avar-steed, or winner of the
Derby, or anything else you choose, to mine
host of the Black Eagle; he keeps it for his
OAvn private use, but I persuaded him to lend
it me, promising to be most careful of the
precious beast."


\"When did you arrive ?" questioned
Olivier.


\"Two hours ago; I took the night train to
Chartres, got there at midnight; came on to
Malleray in the diligence, in the rotonde, think
of that! pounded my bones for five hours, got
to Malleray, with what was left of me,
ravenous; breakfasted, obtained this jewel of a
mount that you behold, and rode on here to
surprise you—in which design I have signally
failed."


\"I'm not so sure of that," observed Claire,
laughing.
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 168 -->

"What had you to do in Paris all of a
sudden ?" asked Olivier.


"What had I to do?" echoed Henri,—
\"Why, your business, my friend, and I've
done it?"  
  
  
  " Done what?" cried both Olivier and Claire

together.


Count Dupont came to a full stop, and, with
intense satisfaction sparkling in his eyes, " I've
worsted the church!" replied he; " I've stopped
the Vivienne candidature."  
  
  
  " Henri! " exclaimed the Marquis.


\"Oh ! do tell us hoAv," petitioned Claire,
eagerly.


\"Well, it was easy enough," resumed
Dupont; " you knoAv, or don't know, that I, too,
have alliances amongst the Philistines. I, as
you do knoAv, have kept aloof from them,
and they are (for that reason) always making
advances to me, so I simply dropped doAvn
amongst them, and urged Avith might and
main the nomination of the Bishop of St.
Germain as coadjutor of Chantilly. You don't
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 169 -->
clearly understand me yet, I see, but I'll
explain by-and-by. In those parts the
government Avants me terribly, on account of their
difficulties Avith the general council touching
the great line of railroad they are projecting;
I had only one visit to make to the Minister
of, and all Avas done; the old archbishop
Avas persuaded that he had always longed for
his colleague of St. Germain, so, noAv he's got
him, and everybody's content! They bothered
me to go and see the Emperor, but I didn't
think it necessary to go that length. Is any
circular out from Mont-Vivienne ? "  
  
  
  " None."


\"And none will ever appear now," chuckled
Henri.


\"What, you suppose then," said the young
Marquise, " that the curd of Belespoir was the
sole mover of everything there ?"


\"I'm certain of it," replied Henri; " you
leave the Mont-Vivienne people to me. I'll
drive over there before dinner this very day,
and I'll answrer for it they Avill coalesce with
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 170 -->
us noAv. The Duke, Avhen he's left to himself,
is the most upright and sensible of men."


"Then, in reality, now," remarked Claire,
\"Olivier has no opponent, and comes in quite
naturally."


\"Of that I am not so sure," replied Henri.
\"On the contrary, I fancy there is a
government candidate somewhere, but avIio it is I
don't yet knoAv, and I didn't Avait for the
knowledge, because I thought my presence
more useful here. But I have an old friend in
the Home Office, and he will telegraph to me
down here, either to-day or to-morrow, if the
government does fix on anyone. MeanAvhile
have your circular out, old felloAv, as fast as
possible."


\"But we can't get it," answered both Olivier
and Claire.


Count Dupont de Laporte started tAvo hours
later for Mont-Vivienne, and didn't return that

night.


The next morning he was at Beauvoisin for
breakfast. Both the Marquis and his wife
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 171 -->
Avere on the stone steps leading into the grand
entrance when they heard from afar the wheels
of the dog-cart approaching.


"All settled there!" cried joyfully Henri
Dupont, as he sprang doAvn from the vehicle
and held out his hands to his host and hostess.
\"The Duke and Gaston, and everybody
behaved admirably, and we all join together, all
the decent people of the county, to back you.
By the Lord! but you never did see such a
face as the curd of Belespoir made (for I began
with him) Avhen I shoAved him the official
announcement of the coadjutorship in the
Moniteur! HoAvever, he soon righted himself,
and came over to Mont-Vivienne in the
evening, and held forth eloquently about the aAAd'ul
unreliability of the Government, and the
sinfulness of any division in the Conservative party
on account of the temporal power of the Pope,
and so uoav Ave're all united like one man!"


\"There's a telegram for you," said Claire,
handing an envelope to Count Dupont, " it
came this morning at daybreak."
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 172 -->
  
  Henri tore it open, but when he had read it:


\"Impossible ! " he exclaimed, " It can't be—
no, that Avould be too strong !" and he indulged
in a fit of genuine, irrepressible laughter.


Olivier and Claire looked inquiringly at him,
and when his hilarity was somewhat calmed,—


\"My dear fellow," he said, " it is really too
great a piece of fun; Avho do you think is
thencandidate ? You'll never guess, you can't guess  
  
  
  I defy you."  
  
  
  " Then tell! " exclaimed Claire, impatiently.  
  
  
  " Why, Mardonnet! "


\"What, the old postmaster ?" asked the
Marquise.  
  
  
  " No ! his Avorshipful son! "


\"You don't mean the man Avho was a
doAvnright Red, a Journalist, and of whom all sorts
of stories are told ? " added Claire.


\"Yes, I do; him! him, himself and no
other! The bosom friend of the sub-prefect of
Malleray."


\"Oh ! hoAv glad I am ! " cried Claire,
clapping her hands for joy; " it is so delightful not
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 173 -->
to haATe to oppose one of one's owm kind; so
delightful to have to fight against abominable,
Avorthless creatures of that sort !"


\"Yes, I confess this promises real sport,"
retorted Henri; " Ave'll bring this boar to bay,
old boy, and get no end of fun out of him!"
and he slapped Olivier heartily on the back.


Olivier spoke no Avord, which passed
unnoticed, and Olivier turned exceedingly pale,
Avhich passed unnoticed also.
<!-- Leaf 184 -->
  
  CHAPTER XV.  
  
  
  THE NEW CANDIDATE.


When the scheme invented by the curd of
Belespoir was ripe, M. Daudel, the ruler of
Malleray acted, and determined to outwit his
priestly adversary. He simply Avent straight
up to Paris, represented, in certain very high
quarters, Avhere he knew such news would be
attended to,—that clerical intrigues of the
most dangerous species Avere likely to organise
a system of religious re-action in the
department; that the prefect (poor, dear, excellent
man,) was taken in, and that, if the
government did not do something, there was no
saying Avhat might not happen. He Avas
listened to, and it Avas decided to start an
official candidate in Savre-et-Merle. But who ?
well, just no one in particular; it so happening
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 175 -->
that, at that identical juncture, those exalted,
or busy in office, had no definite candidate to
propose. It was a very hot summer;
everybody was absent; the Home Minister Avas at
the sea-side, and the Minister of had
consented, for the time, to take his place.
This was the very man the sub-prefect wanted;
the cousin of Thdophile Mardonnet's mother.
He whom Thdophile Mardonnet's aunt called
Lolo, and spoke of disparagingly.


The matter was promptly settled; the
subprefect secured for himself a supporter in the
future representative of Savre-et-Merle, and
the Minister of added another to the
group of deputies upon whom he could count
in the Legislative Chamber, and who, on all
occasions, where he was personally attacked,
would vote for him like one man. Everybody
was satisfied, and most of all, Thdophile
Mardonnet, whose dreams of political
greatness seemed now on the eve of being
fulfilled.  
  
  
  His friend the sub-prefect returned to
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 176 -->
Maileray the moment he had secured in Paris
the object for which he went thither.
Mardonnet agreed to follow him on the next day;
and on this, the eve of his first entrance on so
important and so new a career, he sought aid
and counsel of his Egeria, Mile, de
Mourjonville. As the Marquis de Moranges Avas at
Brunoy, and Claudine more in the dependency
of our friend Aspasie than ever, the latter
could dispose of her time pretty freely, and
she accordingly disposed of the evening in
question in favour of the future legislator.
Mardonnet offered her a dinner at Brdbants,
Avhich she accepted, but a few hours later this
pair might be seen together in a small room
on the fifth story of a house in the Rue
Poissonniere, AArhich Mardonnet dignified with
the name of his study. Both were standing,
and Mile, de Mourjonville seemed preparing to
take her departure; an open box was betAveen
them on a large table, with a secret drawer in
it wide open also. Aspasie held in one hand
a paper; it looked like the envelope of a letter.
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 177 -->
They had apparently been engaged in a
someAAdiat animated dispute, for whilst Mile, de
Mourjonville looked maliciously satisfied (there
Avas a curious mixture of bitterness in her
contentment), Mardonnet wore all the marks of
having suffered a defeat which humiliated and
disturbed him. As he laid his fat hand on the
open box,—  
  
  
  "Wouldn't it be better there?" said he,

deprecatingly.


A sneer of ineffable contempt played over
Aspasie's thin lips.


\"It's because it can be no good save in my
keeping, that it will never get back there
again," she replied, pointing to the box; " so
noAV play your cards well, make no
concessions, come to no compromises, and therewith
good-bye, for it's getting late, Camille will be
coming home, and I Avill have no scenes of
conjugal jealousy Avith my adorable sister."


She held the paper in her hand tighter than
ever, and thrust that hand into the pocket hole
of her dress, holding out the fingers of the  
  
  
  H  
  
  
  VOL. II.
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 178 -->
other to Mardonnet. He kissed them, shook
his head, and accompanied his visitor to the
door.


"I have always said it, Aspasie," he
remarked, in an almost rueful tone; " you could
make me do anything you liked ! anything—
and I don't half like what you've made me do
to-night."


\"I knoAv you don't," was the rejoinder,
\"but then, pray, why didn't you put it out of
my power to do it? Avhy didn't you destroy
the trace long ago ? "  
  
  
  " Well! one don't "know," murmuredThdophile, " one never quite "


\"One ! " echoed mischievously Aspasie;
\"nonsense about one ! all men noAv-a-days are
like that; you're all of you absolutely good for
nothing, and yet not bad—only weaker than
babies; no ! no ! my excellent Thdophile, you
are not to be trusted, whether to do Avrong or
right, but now I hold the position, and you
can't go far AArong, so good-bye, and try and
make a good thing of the deputation.—Good
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 179 -->
Lord, what geese these men all are!" she
added, as she tripped down the stairs.


Early the next morning Thdophile
Mardonnet started for the fortunate department
which was to enjoy the honour of possessing
him as its representative.


Mile, de Mourjonville was right Avhen she
told Thdophile Mardonnet he was not to be
trusted. He was the most unreliable of human
beings, and not one bit more to be relied upon
by his accomplices in Avrong than by those
Avho might perchance coalesce with him to do
right. He was low-minded, flat-souled, a vulgar
believer in baseness, but at the same time what
his countrymen term a hon enfant, for which
there is no equivalent in any other tongue
("good fellow" won't do, and is wanting in
the sense of total irresponsibility implied by
the French phrase).


It is a great mistake to infer one defect
from another, and it was precisely one of the  
  
  
  chief causes of the blunders so often committed  
  
  
  N 2
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 180 -->
by princes, ministers, and other men in poAver,
in times Avhen they had recourse to vile
instruments to work out vile ends, and thought that
unlimited corruption was sufficient to insure
the applicability of a man to all the designs
of perversity. Corruption weakens, distends,
softens, and there is no more resemblance
betAveen a merely corrupt and a perverse nature
than there is betAveen mud and stone. Mud
is dirty, but Avon's answer the purpose of
flint.


Now, Thdophile Mardonnet's Avas eminently
a muddy mind, swampy, unclean, but unsteady
above all. He loved all coarse pleasures in
their coarsest shape, and, as I said, when I
first introduced him to the reader, he Avas
persuaded everyone else did so too. But these
very pleasures had, by a long continuance,
unnerved and unfitted him for the
accomplishment of any stern purpose. He had
impulses, as we have seen, and under the
influence of a sensation, would commit an act
of utter foolishness. When on his return from
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 181 -->
Barbaria, as he styled the Moldo-Wallachian
provinces, he had caught sight of M. de
Beauvoisin in the street on Easter Sunday, he
obeyed one of these absurd impulses, and was
moATed to accost Olivier by recollections of
days gone by, in which foul enjoyments had
brought them together—days in which he,
Mardonnet, had lost his head for Camille
Leblond, and thought that loATely syren cheap
at any price.


Of such men no consistent criminal was
ever made, and this our friend Aspasie had
not to learn. She kneAV that you may stick
fast in these fat, flabby natures, and be
wonderfully embarrassed to get rid of them, but
that as to stiffening or hardening them, or
making it safe to trust to them, this is beyond
the science or skill of any magician.


AVhen Thdophile Mardonnet arrived at
Malleray he was charmed AAith the notion of
becoming a deputy, and believed that the fact
of having a contest before him—a contest
AAdth the two leading families of the
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 182 -->
department—inspired him with genuine delight. But
this was a piece of the purest self-delusion.
At the bottom of his heart Monsieur Thdophile
loved only easy achievements, and was
persuaded that, thanks to the rivalry betAveen the
Beauvoisins and Viviennes, he, as the
acknowledged official candidate, should be elected
Avithout any trouble or over-exertion. There
was no thirst for sport in the man's nature, not
the slightest love of fun, and it needed but a
few hours for the sub-prefect to find this out.
Marius Daudel Avas of the lean kine, sharp,
keen, and eager, and worth ten of Mardonnet's
species, and at the very outset he suspected his
friend would turn out a failure. But he was
not of a nature to be so promptly foiled, and
he resolved to carry his candidate through,
whether the latter helped him or not. Marius
Daudel Avas not disposed to stick at trifles; he
kneAv his colleague at Combeville Avould go all
lengths in a campaign against Royalists and
Jesuits, as he styled them, and therefore,
relying on his own energy, and prepared to
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 183 -->
have recourse to the most unscrupulous deAdces,
Marius Daudel regarded the election for
Savreet-Merle as thoroughly secure.


Two days after his return from Paris, the
sub-prefect boldly made his appearance at
Beauvoisin and expressed himself well-pleased
Avith Olivier's circular (which had been
suffered to come forth, and had been placarded
in the streets of Malleray the day before), but
he added that he sincerely regretted to be
incapable now of doing anything save oppose all
independent candidates, seeing that the
government had determined upon bringing forward
a special champion of their oavq, to Avhose
support he, as the head functionary of the
arrondissement, was, of course, committed.
He hoped the Dowager and her son Avould
take into consideration his official position,
and ascribe only to its necessities any acts of
seeming hostility to which he might, in spite
of himself, be obliged; and when he took his
leave it was with a certain air of cordiality,
especially with Count Dupont de Laporte, who
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 184 -->
made him feel extremely uncomfortable, and
from Avhose good-natured off-hand familiarity
he could not make himself free.


On leaving Beauvoisin he repaired to
MontViAdenne, where he Avas politely received as
usual, but where he obtained the confirmation
of Avhat he had till iioav refused to credit:

namely, that the so recently rival candidatures
had merged into a single one, and that the
O o r
Vivienne party would strain every nerAre to
secure the nomination of the Marquis de
Beauvoisin. For this Marius Daudel Avas not
prepared, and it rather disconcerted him. He
had heard on reaching Malleray on his return
from Paris that the Duke had retired, but he
fancied that it might be possible to neutralise
his opposition to Mardonnet, by his rancour
against the neighbour who had but so lately
been in the field against himself. To find the
ViAdenne and Beauvoisin factions united, and
pulling heartily together, was a disappointment,
and the sub-prefect could not quite conceal
that he felt it to be one. It puzzled him too,
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 185 -->
to explain; he did not clearly see what could
have brought it about. Why was the wily
cure' of Belespoir, Avho had been all for
the Duke, now so energetically all for the
Marquis ? It was perplexing and exceedingly
vexatious.


\"It will divide the department, Monsieur le
Due," said incautiously the sub-prefect.


\"I am sure we ought to feel proud of such
an admission from you," rejoined courteously
the cure of Belespoir, Avho was present, " for
it shows us that in your esteem the forces of
the two parties are well matched, and that we
AAdio have nothing to offer, save the devotion to
Avhat we call the right, can have an equal
chance with the nominees and functionaries of
the great imperial government."


\"You Avill count no votes in the toAvns,"
retorted snappishly the sub-prefect.


\"We shall see," responded mildly the curd,
\"the rural populations may "


\"Oh ! there, I beg your pardon,"
interrupted Marius Daudel, groAving angry under
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 186 -->
the biting perfidy of the churchman's eye and
smile, " there you have no chance whatever—
the peasant is devoted to the imperial dynasty
body and soul!"


\"But God forbid that we should harbour a
thought against the imperial dynasty !"
exclaimed the cure; " Ave also are devoted to it.
Since when, my dear M. Daudel, is the fact of
a deputy's aspiring to independence of opinion
to be set down as identical Avith hostility
to the glorious family uoav sitting on the
throne?"


\"I'm sine I don't know !" ejaculated Daudel,
growing savage and striving to conceal it;
"but I knoAv it is a great pity to divide
departments in this way—and only just see;
here is an official candidate, and Avhat does he
find ? Wiy, all the large landed proprietors
in a league against him : you, Monsieur le.
Due and the Marquis de Beauvoisin, and the
Comte de Clavreuil, all "


\"You forget Count Dupont," observed
provokingly the cure, "a great proprietor, but a
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 187 -->
confirmed Liberal—an advanced one—not of
Avhat is termed oui set "  
  
  
  Marius Daudel was enraged.


\"Well!" he retorted. " Say everybody—
all the possessors of the sod ! You really must
not be surprised if the imperial government,
Avhich is sprung from the people and reigns for
the people, sees in such leagues as these the
determined opposition of a caste, of a clique,
to the interests and desires of the many—you
must not be surprised if Ave retaliate, if Ave
have recourse to all means in the Avay of
resistance. You drive the government, you
drive us, its agents, to extreme measures."


\"I trust we shall knoAv how to combat
them, sir," said the Due de Vivienne, with
dignity.


He had scarcely spoken hitherto, leaving the
cure to repel the functionary's attacks.


\"It is not our wont to fly from danger, and
as you are good enough to think that our
forces are so nearly matched, why, we will
loyally try to carry off the victory, and hope
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 188 -->
that the government AAall not condescend to
resort to such means as honest gentlemen must
always remain in ignorance of."


The sub-prefect left Mont-Vivienne
dissatisfied, and as he passed before the post-office at
Malleray to reach the sub-prefecture, AAdio
should he see mounting his horse at the old
postmaster's door but Count Dupont, Avho
boAved to him in a most disagreeably
patronising way.


While Marius Daudel had been making his
recognisance at Mont-Vivienne, Henri Dupont
had gone straight at the head-quarters of the
enemy himself. He had made a descent on
the old postmaster, and sat an hour with him
and with Madame Hdloise Picard, talking
freely and pleasantly of the coming contest,
and pitying old Mardonnet for the share of
odium he would come in for later, and
Avondering at the simplicity Avith Avhich his son had
alloAved himself to be caught in the
government trap.  
  
  
  This told on both sides. Old Mardonnet,
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 189 -->
firm-seated in his conviction that whatever
was, was for the sole benefit of aristocrats and
clericals, and the other great of the earth,
came easily over to the idea of his son being a
madman for dreaming of an electoral contest in
the conditions Count Dupont described; and
Madame Picard set M. Thdophile doAvn as a
fool for not perceiving that the government
(and above all, Lolo, as she termed the minister
of ) were taking him in.


Henri Dupont rode away laughing to
himself over the impression he had produced at the
post-office, and made the young Marquise share
his hilarity when he recounted to her the scene.


Monsieur Thdophile disliked exceedingly the
aspect of affairs as described to him in the
most discouraging manner by his relatives, and
Avhen he sought comfort from his friend the
sub-prefect, he only got reproached for his lack
of pluck.


It was evident that the independent faction
was in the ascendant, and things looked
brilliantly for Olivier.
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 190 -->

As the late post went out (the Paris bag was
called for at ten at Malleray, and often, when
there Avere feAv letters, only made up after
supper),—


\"There's Theophile's handAvriting," remarked
Madame Picard, looking at the letters lying
on the table before old Mardonnet; " addressed
to a Avoman too : I wonder Avho she may be ?"  
  
  
  The postmaster took the letter up :—


\"Mademoiselle de Mourjonville, 300, Rue
de Grenelle," mumbled he, reading the address,
\"ah ! Avell, he's always the same, always after
women !"


Madame Hdloise turned up her nose with an
absolute jerk, sniffing powerfully.


\"I thought," she said with disgust, " that
Avhen men went and married such creatures as
that Avoman," (this Avas her way of alluding
to Madame Thdophile nee Cam ill o. Leblond),
\"they kept to them."


\"Perhaps generally," opined old Mardonnet,
\"but Theophfle is incorrigible—a very Don
Juan ! Women will be the ruin of him."
<!-- Leaf 201 -->
  
  THE NEW CANDIDATE. 191

"Pah!" cried Madame Heloise, as though
vindicating the superiority of her entire sex
with one word, " such nasty coarse tastes as
men have \"
<!-- Leaf 202 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVI.  
  
  
  BELOAV THE MARK.


The election Avas fixed for the 14th of July,
and the 5th had come and passed.


I Avish my reader to remark this date, for on
the 5th of July, amongst the letters which
Avere delivered to the Marquis de Beauvoisin
after breakfast, there Avas one which arrested
his attention in no ordinary degree. He said
nothing, but, lighting a cigar, sauntered forth
and smoked under the shade of the trees on
the lawn. If anything really did disturb him
no one noticed it.


Olivier rode out that day alone, and did
not return to the chateau for dinner. But
Avhen dinner was over, a stable boy from the
Black Eagle at Malleray brought back the
Marquis's horse, and also with it a slip of
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 193 -->
paper addressed to the Dowager, on Avhich the
Marquis had Avritten in pencil that a telegram
just received obliged him to go up to Paris on
business, but that he should be at home again
in thirty-six hours. He desired that the
dogcart might be sent to Malleray on the next
day but one, early in the morning, so as to
meet him at his descent from the Chartres
diligence, which, as we knowT, corresponded
Avith the Paris-Chartres night-train.


This was a very odd proceeding on Ofivier's
part. The Dowager was so used to managing
her son's affairs that she was at a loss to
conceive how be could have any business of which
she should not be better informed than himself.
The young Marquise was annoyed, and thought
that her husband made a mistake in absenting
himself even for a day, at a time when his
presence Avas so indispensable; and Henri
Dupont was fairly bothered (I cannot find
another wrord for his peculiar feeling on the
occasion) because, in spite of himself, he
believed in neither the business nor the telegram.  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  o
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 194 -->

However, at the appointed time on the
folloAAdng day but one, that is on the 7th of July,
early in the morning, the dog-cart was sent to
Malleray and duly brought back the Marquis
de Beauvoisin, who, as he had said, had
returned from Paris by the Chartres night-train.


He had been as good as his word, and had
only stayed away thirty-six hours, yet there
Avas something constrained in his manner on
his return home, and in the manners of those
Avho met him there.


His father-in-laAv had come over from
Clavreuil to report progress as to Avhat Avas doing
in Combeville, and Madame de ClaATreuil this
time accompanied him. From all sides good
neAvs came in. Monsieur Tarbet, the notary,
sparkled all over with joy, and maintained,
against the sceptical doctor, that the
populations in France, the masses, as they are noAv
denominated, Avere in a far more healthy frame
of mind than Avas generally believed, and
perfectly disposed to rally round the old
traditional families the instant the latter showed a
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 195 -->
real interest in public affairs. Dr. Robichon
himself was forced to admit that Olivier's
chances were vastly better than he had at first
supposed possible; but he persisted in it that
everything was owing to Count Dupont. " It
is his influence does it all," growded the
Æsculapian democrat; "his grandfather Avas a
Jacobin, his father an Orleanist, and he is a
Republican (if he's anything at all!)."


Tallard, the Marquis de Moranges' factotum
at Brunoy, drove over perpetually with
wonderful accounts of the state of things in that
part of the province. The Marquis was absent
and would only return in a feAv days, but he
had Avritten to the Due de Vivienne, a letter
which had absolutely electrified that entire
clan, and the sub-prefect of Brunoy (an honest
man as we have said, but feeble and totally
unfit for his post) had admitted to the
Taxcollector (av!io had repeated it to his Avife) that
it was quite impossible to make any way
against the united forces of all the great
proprietors leagued together.  
  
  
  o 2
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 196 -->

And there, in fact, lay the Avhole secret; for
once there was union, real and perfect union,
and against the government too !


The curd of Belespoir and his uncle, the
bishop, Avere pulling together heartily Avith old
Robichon and his democrats; and wdiile the
Mont Vivienne faction was stirring up the
peasant forces that inevitably support immense
territorial Avealth judiciously employed, the
tiers-etat of the toAvns rallied to a man round
Henri Dupont de Laporte.


The prefect was beginning to feel so
uncomfortable in his neAV position that he had already
conferred Avith his secretary-general (Avho had
never liked Marius Daudel) upon the necessity
of sending up a report to Paris to say Avhat a
mistake the sub-prefect of Malleray had made,
and hoAv probable it was that the government
Avould be reduced to suffer a great defeat in
Savre-et-Merle. The Corsican at Combeville
was left untouched in this document, not even
alluded to; it Avas safer to censure the Parisian,
and so, paving-stones of blame (cart-loads of
<!-- Leaf 207, Page: 197 -->
them) were being got ready wherewith to crush
the meddling intriguer, the Bohemian
pennya-liner (the secretary-general styled him thus
Avhen he had confidential chats with his prefect)
at Malleray.


Marius Daudel himself began not to feel
thoroughly at his ease, for he was quite aware
that his only hopes rested upon complete
success. He aspired to govern the whole
Department, but he did not require to be told
that he himself would be the first victim if,
instead of securing the nomination of a
thorough-going Imperialist deputy he should
prove to have only set the country by the ears,
and united together against the government all
the various forces of the opposition. He had
not counted on the Viviennes and the clericals
giving unanimous support to the Beauvoisin
party, and bold as he was, and" capable of
everything," he was perplexed. Then, too, he
got no encouragement whatever from his own
pet. Old Mardonnet was for ever urging the
madness of attempting to make head against
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 198 -->
the great people, as he called them, the
landlords and the clergy; Avhile Madame Heloise
Picard giggled, viciously derisive, over the
ridiculous idea of having trusted to a minister,
and that minister your OAvn cousin, too.


All tins home discouragement Avas odious to
Monsieur Thdophile. It bored and pierced
into him, grated on him till not his teeth only
but [his Arery bones felt on edge, and his
patience, oozing aAvay with his courage, he (if
the expression be allowed me) desponded
energetically. Like all Aveak men of his kind, he
was furious with those Avhose feet he Avould
have kissed had they obtained all he Avished
for Avithout giving him any trouble. He
grumbled at Marius Daudel for not having
rendered to himself a clearer account of the
position, and snarled at Mile. Mourjon for not
having saved him from his own ambitious
dreams. He Avould have bitten the hand of
his Egeria had he dared.


Meanwhile Henri Dupont had been so
active, and so intelligently served by his
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 199 -->
various allies, that Olivier's chances did with
each day seem to become better and more
certain, Olivier himself, however, had relapsed
into his indolent Avays of heretofore, and the
old torpor re-asserted itself so manifestly over
his nature that, far from being the one central
point of the agitation that was kept up around
him, M. de Beauvoisin had the appearance of a
spectator rather indifferent than otherwise to
the exciting game that was being played.


His wife found no trace of the bluntly
laconic but firm determination with which he
had supported her against the curd of
Belespoir. She regretted this, and was sorry for
his lukeAvarmness, in not only his OAvn cause,
but the cause, as she thought it, of all upright
honest men, against an unrighteous
government; but it could not be helped. Olivier's
nature Avas not to be changed; but he was
certain to be the Deputy for S&vre-et-Merle
for all that. Henri Dupont had so managed
matters that the victory was now as good as
achieved; and a signal victory it was; and
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 200 -->
from many quarters at once, from Paris and
from the provinces, there came letters to the
young Marquise, and to the Dowager, as well
as to Count Dupont, full of congratulations
and compliments upon the excellent example
set by the independent electors of
Savre-etMerle. Claire was very proud of the general
public esteem which (whether Olivier
personally contributed to Avin it or not) Avould
surround the name Olivier, as her husband, made
her Avear, and Avhich was to be inherited by
her son.


The day after M. de Beauvoisin's return
from Paris, Count Dupont, who had been the
Avhole night on the road, driving from one end
of the department to the other, and marshalling
his forces Avith consummate generalship, burst
into the library at Beauvoisin, where the
members of the tAvo families of BeauA^oisin and
ClaATeuil Avere seated alone, and, with an
exexplosion of triumphant glee,—


\"By the Lord!" exclaimed he,
unceremoniously, and shaking hands with each one
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 201 -->
in turn. " By the Lord ! but that has been
well played ! " and dusty and traArel-stained as
he was, he let himself drop into an arm-chair
covered with delicate-tinted old tapestry, and
indulged in a good hearty laugh of
self-gratulation. All watched him eagerly (except Olivier,
Avho was seemingly half-asleep upon a
rockingchair), and on Claire's sweet countenance
laughter seemed only waiting for a Avord to
break forth in the effervescence of its brilliancy.
\"Yes, they are out-manœuvred this time,"
recommenced Dupont, Avhen he had drawn
breath. " But Avhat tricks wfll they not be up
to to-morrow ? Imagine what they had been
at! Three days ago I found out that through
the whole ConibeA-ille district—yours, Monsieur
le Comte" (and he bowed to M. de ClaATreuil)
■—" the principal Adllages had received not one
copy of Olivier's circular, and the inhabitants
hardly knew that any canvass for an election
wTas going on."


\"Ah! the Corsican!" muttered M. de
Qavreuil
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 202 -->

"Yes, the Corsican, if you Avill," echoed
Henri Dupont; " but still more the invention
of the man at Malleray, who is the master-spirit
(the Corsican is a mere subaltern, mischievous
as the plague, but a subaltern). Well, what
they had imagined Avas to enjoin upon the
tavern-keepers in each locality (they're all
their own spies, all of 'em to a man !) to get
hold of the hawkers of Olivier's circular, make
them drunk, then seize the papers they came
to distribute, and lock these up till some agent
of authority came to ask for them. I found
this out luckily, so I got together twelve of my
keepers, felloAvs I can trust, and caused them to
be beforehand Avith the sub-prefect. They've
been at Avork for twenty-four hours throughout
the eastern end of the Department, and there's
not a tavern or Avine-shop keeper who can
stand on his legs in the Avhole Combeville
district! my felloAvs are as sober as judges, and
Olivier's circular is in every man's hands!
There's my Avork since yesterday."  
  
  
  " Bravo ! bravo!" came from all sides, mixed
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 203 -->
Avith laughter so hearty that no one noticed
how silent OliAder was.


"That is all very Avell," remarked M. de
Clavreuil; "and has been a lucky hit for this
once, but they (the government people) Avill
begin again; and if they are resolved (as I
believe) to carry their official candidate through,
they will resort to such means that, do what
you will, they will get the better of you.
Suppose they falsify the votes, seeing all else
fail, (they have done it before noAV,) what
redress have you ? Who watches over the
urns, pray ? Why, they and their hirelings ! "


While his father-in-law was speaking, the
Marquis de Beauvoisin seemed interested by
what he said, and looked at him attentively.


\"I am so persuaded of what you say,
Monsieur le Comte," replied Henri Dupont; " I
am so persuaded that if they are determined to
go all lengths (and Daudel is wholly
unscrupulous), they can always carry any election
(subject to the public exposure that the
ATanquished party can provoke later); I am so
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 204 -->
persuaded of this, that I have another plan in
my head, and I shall probably execute ittomorroAV morning."


\"And that is ?" questioned Claire and the
DoAvager both at once.


\"And that is, to pack up the official
candidate himself, and send him within forty-eight
hours from this back to his Boulevards."


Many-toned Avere the exclamations of
admiration at this declaration.


\"I have reconnoitred the position narrowly
these few days," continued Count Dupont,
\"and I am noAv morally certain that that
vagabond, Thdophile Mardonnet, Avould give
his ears to be out of the mess. He did not
reckon on a fight, he has not the nerve for
that; nor, do I believe, has he a past that can
bear inspection, and inspected it shall be; if
any one will take up my Avager, I will lay one,
that by to-morroAV night's coach to Chartres I
expedite Monsieur Thdophile, ticketing him,
'fragfle,' and bear the news of his sudden
departure to his friend the sub-prefect Avithout
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 205 -->
the said worthy having so much as guessed at
Avhat was going on."


\"Well, if you could manage that—" opined
{empty}M. de Clavreuil.


\"That Avould be first-rate," interposed the
Dowager.


"By this time to-morrow it shall be settled,"
said, gaily, Henri Dupont; " and now I'll go
and get rid of all this dust."


\"One moment, Henri," objected Olivier as
his friend jumped up from his seat, " you have
not asked my opinion; and—" he hesitated,
and bending forAvards on his rocking-chair, so
that no one saw his face, " and," he continued,
\"I'm sick of the whole thing, and don't mean
to be a deputy at all! "


He uttered the last phrase loudly and Avith
great volubility, and, leaving his seat, walked
towards a Avindow, turning his back to
everybody in the room.


It is difficult, in such cases, to describe the
impression produced, and which embodies
itself differently in each individual; but, above
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 206 -->
the various ejaculations which greeted M. de
Beauvoisin's sudden proclamation, the one
Avord " Olivier!" pronounced sternly by
his mother, was distinctly audible. For
the first time it, apparently, failed in its
effect.


\"He is only jesting," observed Henri
Dupont; " how can you seem to take him in
earnest ? But it is an unseasonable joke," he
added, more seriously, and going up to Avhere
Olivier stood. " You must remember, my dear
felloAV, that you no longer stand alone here
noAv; you have set in motion the forces of the
opposition in the entire Department, and all
this is long past a joke."


Olivier turned suddenly round, and was, this
time, evidently at bay.


\"I am not joking," he exclaimed; " but I
am tired of being made a puppet of, and I Avill
be so no longer. I hate parties and politics,
and Avill have nothing more to do Avith tliem.
I have been dragged into all this—as into
everything else—against my will."
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 207 -->

\"Olivier ! " burst forth in Claire's pure tones,
in strong reproachfulness.


\"I Avill not be bullied or cajoled," he
continued. " I will not be treated like a cypher
in my own house. I will have my OAvn way
like other men, and do that which pleases me.
I have my own tastes and my own pleasures;
and politics have nothing to do Avith them. I
tell you I am sick to death of the whole thing,
and it is I who retire from the contest. I
have Avritten to the prefect to tell him so; and,
as I defy you to make a deputy of me without
my consent, I wash my hands of the AAdiole
business. I A\ill hear no more of it!" and,
AAdth these words, he overstepped the threshold
of the Avindow and was gone.


Consternation was many-tongued upon this
extraordinary behaviour of Olivier's. The
Dowager said he must be insane; M. de
ClaArreuil was for strong measures, and forcing
him to do his duty; Henri Dupont
recommended a few hours' patience; and Claire,
concentrating her indignation into one sentence,—
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 208 -->

\"These," said she, " are the fruits of the
education you have given him;" and, looking
Avith haughty contempt at the Dowager, she
left the room.


Late in the day, Count Dupont caught sight
of Olivier in a passage leading to his own
apartment. One glance sufficed to shoAV him
signs of dejection in M. de Beauvoisin, which
ill contrasted with the strange fierceness of
manner he had so recently affected. He darted
forwards, and, before his presence Avas
perceived, he Avas standing close to his friend,
and held one of the latter's hands in his

o\vn.


\"Olivier," he said, AAdth affectionate
earnestness (for the countenance he looked upon gave
him no desire to do aught save try to soothe),
"my dear, good, old felloAv, we are far too
firm friends for any discussion Avhatever to
sever us. Is it possible you can be serious in
what you said this morning ?"


Olivier's face Avas terribly haggard and
drawn. He answered nothing, but stared at
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 209 -->
  
  Henri Dupont as though looking through and
beyond him.


\"My dear Olivier," continued Henri, "what
has happened ?"


"Nothing at all," replied Olivier, eagerly.
\"Happened ? Avhy, what should happen ? "


\"But Avhy, then, this sudden retreat ? "
urged Count Dupont; " think it Avell over, my
dear Olivier."


\"I have thought it well over," Avas the
ansAver, but this time gently made, though in
a tone and Avith an expression that struck
dismay into the hearer.  
  
  
  " And must it be ?"
"It must be."


\"Olivier," hazarded Dupont, " Claire—your
Avife—" (he felt the hand he held in his quiver)
—" you Avill lose—is there no means of—"


\"None; I cannot help myself, Henri," he
added, in utter helplessness; and then, as
though suddenly remembering a part he had
forgotten to play,—" it is unbearable ! " he
exclaimed, in a loud voice, and with a flurried  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  r
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 210 -->
manner; " it is unbearable that one can't have
one's own way! No friendship can stand such
tyranny ! " and, breaking violently from Henri
Dupont, he rushed into his own room.


The letter M. de Beauvoisin had received
on the 5th of July, contained these words :—


\"If the official candidate is not elected,
things that occurred seven years ago Avill be
brought to light, and utter ruin ensue. There
are people here Avho have proofs. If you can
pass a few hours here to-morrow, I may be
able to help you; if not, I see no safety
anywhere. Rely on my friendship,  
  
  
  " Asp,"
<!-- Leaf 221 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVII.  
  
  
  SEVERED.


Tavo months had passed by, and the first
days of September had come. Things did not
exteriorly seem much altered, but deep chasms
were yawning between some of those Avho still
appeared to be standing side by side.


Claire was severed from Olivier, and she
knew not how near she had been to unity with
him. It is one thing to be married and
indifferent, another to be married and divided.
Between the two there had been an
intermediate state, in which, as I have said, the
young Marquise had been draAvn by
circumstance towards her husband, and the
eAreryday habits of wedded life becoming cheerfully
established, these two had well-nigh drifted
into a certain oneness that, with time, would  
  
  
  r 2
<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 212 -->
have grown to imitate affection. Claire
rendered to herself no account of this till it
ceased. Henri Dupont rendered to himself
the clearest possible account of it the instant
he saw this pair together, and was so rejoiced,
that, when the Avhole fabric of coming domestic
harmony was suddenly threatened by Olivier's
conduct about the election, his grief Avas
profound and bitter.


Henri had had great hopes for his friend
when he returned from Paris at the end of
June, and was met, as we know, in the Avoods
by M. de Beauvoisin and his Avife,—together!
He had never ventured to hope that any
tender feeling would spring up betAveen Olivier
and Claire; but of a kindly, affectionate good
understanding, he all at once thought he
perceived symptoms, and he Avas delighted in
proportion to his surprise. As with all things
unexpected—perhaps even undeserved—Henri
held more to his neAv discovery than if it had
been a matter of course and long foreseen
consequence. It was much more than that; it
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 213 -->
Avas a bit of luck—therefore unreasonable;
therefore belonging to those hidden treasures
that Fate stores up wherewith to gratify blind
mortals, and over which all mortals Avithout
exception rejoice Avith childlike impulse. What
we have calculated upon, we have already
enjoyed in anticipation; when it reaches our
hand it is discounted—realised; we know all
about it; but of that which is vouchsafed to
us all at once, of that which comes to us by
chance, we knowT nothing, and therein lies its
charm. There is no one so flat or so low, so
prosaic, or so hard, or so narrow, who is not
gladdened by the touch of the inexplicable.
It is a fresh proof of the mystery of our being,
and whether we avow it or not, we all of us
rejoice in whatever for even one second makes
us dream.


Henri Dupont, plain sailing and practical as
he was, held to any little bit of the unexpected
as we all do; prized it unconsciously far above
any well-deserved long-foreseen result, and was
inconsolable at its loss. It was utterly
<!-- Leaf 224, Page: 214 -->
improbable that the young Marquise should take
to liking the husband Avho had been aAvarded
to her; she was so immeasurably his superior !
she was so lovely, so intellectual, so
highminded !


Henri, when he thought of her to himself,
characterised her in his OAvn mind as so
royal, that her condescending to place herself
on M. de Beauvoisin's level Avas not a fact to
be in any way reasonably looked forward to.
Olivier did not deserve Claire; that was the
plain truth; the logical thing therefore Avas,
that he would not obtain her. But here all
at once the most illogical and improbable
thing had occurred, and the beautiful, and
superior, and regal Claire, had condescended
in a certain degree to her sloAV-witted, dull,
heavy, inferior mate; and pleasant intercourse,
a cheerful exchange of gentle courtesies, would
be established betAveen this pair, their child
Avould groAV to be a strong fink, and some of
the sunshine of life Avould be there for them to
bask in. Olivier Avould be led by his Avife,
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 215 -->
rescued from the Dowager; it was his
salvation; and Henri Dupont counted on the
generosity of Claire's nature for becoming
attached to Avhat so completely depended upon
her.


It Avas this satisfaction of his which had
been overthroAvn. Annihilated almost as
suddenly as created; but annihilated, as he felt,
for ever. There could be no mistaking the
feeling with which the young Marquise
regarded Olivier when he retired from the
contest which, in her opinion, he was in honour
bound to carry on. It was a feeling of
unmitigated contempt. She would never more
relent now; never more soften towards the
man whose name had been given to her, and
Avhom she looked upon as a discredit to that

name.


Claire behaved harshly, it may be said.
Perhaps so,—but Claire was too young not to
have the excess of her finest qualities; too
young to be kind where she did not love; too
pure not to have Avith the bright truth of steel
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 216 -->
some of its hardness. Claire judged Olivier
umvorthy, condemned him from the height of
a tribunal, Avhence she deemed it a disgrace
ever to descend, and was irrevocably severed
from her husband. She judged him all the
more severely, too, that she had been recently
so near relenting in his favour.


In the Department, the effect produced by
the retirement of M. de Beauvoisin Avas,
perhaps, on the Avhole, less startling than might
have been supposed. The Due de Vivienne
was the only person really incensed at first,
for he felt himself compromised, and left in
the lurch; but his nepheAV, Gaston, having, at
the end of a Aveek or so, made him perceive
the chances Avhich Olivier's inexplicable
retreat opened in the future before his oa\th
candidature, he became gradually pacified, and
contented himself Avith grumbling against the
young men of the present day, Avho did not
know their oAvn minds. M. de Clavreuil's
anger at the notion of his son-in-law
havinoretired before an antagonist so ignoble as
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 217 -->
Mardonnet, was counteracted by his joy at the
fact of so near a relative not playing any part
whatever (even that of an independent deputy)
under the imperial regime. Henri Dupont,
whose irritation should have been liveliest,
considering that the security of the election
Avas solely owing to his oaati untiring efforts,—
Henri Dupont was silent; sadly so, it is true,
but his silence screened M. de Beauvoisin from
any immoderate attacks from other people.
Claire alone was implacable, for she neither
noted, nor cared to note in Olivier that which
caused Henri Dupont's compassionate
indulgence; a certain air, namely, of deep
regretfulness which every noAV and then stole over
Olivier's features, and gave them an expression
they had never worn before—an air of hopeless
dejection.


This was of rare occurrence, hoAvever, but
Henri had noted it, and felt pained.
Something told him Olivier had a reason for retiring
from the electoral contest against Mardonnet—
a reason other than the mere purposelessness
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 218 -->
and feebleness of character which Avere
imputed to him; and what pained him most
was that a voice Avithin him Avarned never to
probe Olivier's conscience upon this point
Avith questions. A ATeil Avas draAvn, and Henri
Dupont, out of his very friendship, dared not
lift it. To Count Dupont de Laporte, educated
as he had been, by a really distinguished man,
Olivier had always appeared as morally and
intellectually friendless, and in that lay the
root of his attachment to him. He pitied him
for the little that had been made of him, and
disliked the Dowager (as the DoAvager shrewdly
guessed) for the total absence of heart she had
eAdnced in the education of her only child.
The boy Avas not Avorse than other boys; he
Avas not quick-Avitted, but he Avas otherAvise
not more deficient in judgment and common
sense than the ordinary run of his compeers.
He had no bad instincts, but Avas, on the
contrary, rather of a kind and gentle disposition.
Lazy, because sIoav, and therefore easily
dependent, all the defects progressively acquired
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 219 -->
by Olivier had been grafted upon him by a
determinedly perverse process of bringing
doAvn, instead of bringing up.


Some days before the election, Olivier left
Beauvoisin, and spent the months of July and
August between Paris and Homburg and
Baden-Baden. To the latter place Madame
Claudine had been ordered by the doctors for
a slight affection of the larynx, and there she
Avas established for some weeks, with her
sagacious lady-in-waiting—the now, to her,
indispensable Mile. Aspasie.


Claire, taking her baby Avith her, passed
the month of July with her mother in the
Pyrenees; the month of August at Arcachon
for the benefit of sea-bathing; and the month
of September at Ckvreuil, the home of her

girlhood.
<!-- Leaf 230 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVIII.  
  
  
  THE OLD HOME.


It Avas late in the afternoon Avhen Madame
de Clavreuil and her daughter arrived at
Clavreuil. They had breakfasted at
Angouleme, and settled to find a sort of
dinnersupper on reaching home.


HaAdng seen her child and his nurse
comfortably established in their quarters, Claire
proceeded to her oAvn apartment. It Avas the
one she had occupied before her marriage;
she had particularly petitioned for this
arrangement.


When the young Marquise crossed the
threshold of her room a flood of soft melloAV

sunlight poured golden in through the large,
open AvindoAV, and lighted up all the old
Avhereabouts of her maiden days. Claire had thought
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 221 -->
she should so like to go back to other times—
that she should so enjoy reverting to her
period of girlish freedom; but she was doomed
to disappointment. Other times were altered,
and so was she; and her girlish memories
Avould not consent to afford her any enjoyment
now, but just the reverse.


She threw off her travelling attire, and
proceeded to examine curiously the various details
of her former abode—to see that all Avas as it
Avas Avont to be. All! but AA'hat was all ?
She was not the same, and the consciousness
of that truth struck to her heart Avith a
sudden, bitter chill.


The wind swept in, as of yore, through the
Avindow; the meadoAATs, with then grazing
herds, lay green; the ancient trees threw their
broad shadows over the ground as heretofore;
the same sun wrapt the earth in the same
glory-—but where Avas the Claire aat1io had once
so loved all this ?


She had never been in her oavu country
home since she married; and, in that home,
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 222 -->
the man Avhose wrife she was had never been
a familiar idea, nor had even his name been
ever a household word She turned from the
Avindow, and felt miserable.


On the mantel-piece stood, amongst other
things, a flower-pot of rare old china, a
birthday present of her aunt's. The earth in it Avas
hard and dry as the desert dust; but the
sapless stalk and leafless branches of a dead
rose-tree Avere still there. Once, at a family
gathering at the chateaux, just tAvo years ago
(during the last summer of Claire's girlhood),
she had worn in her hair a bright, blood-red
rose, broken from the plant that stood Avithered
and blackening there before her—that rose she
had given to her cousin Victor. She thought
he had asked her for it—thought he cared for
it—she must have been mistaken, but she had
given it to him.


When the young Marquise went doAvn to
dinner, she had not found time to change her
dress.  
  
  
  "You look ill, Claire," remarked Madame
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 223 -->
de Clavreuil, AAith gentle solicitude. "You
are quite feverish, and your cheeks are burning
red."


Claire said railway travelling always made
her ill, and that she Avould go to bed the
moment dinner was over.


\"You must get well soon," said, gaily, her
father, " for there are to be great festivities
this month; at Mont Vivienne, the whole
province is expected to muster for a
shootingmatch; and, at Tours, there arc to be
carrousels, and races, and heaven knoAvs what.
By-the-bye, you did not know that Victor's
regiment is garrisoned there, and means to
carry off all the prizes. TheyYe been there
about a fortnight; he came OA~er here to see
me yesterday, and is enchanted at the notion  
  
  
  of being our neighbour, and of seeing you

again."


The ensuing days brought Aisitors to
Clavreuil; all the neighbours came in succes
sion, and among the very first Avas M. de
Lancour.
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 224 -->

Claire thought him a little altered in his
manner towards herself, a trifle graver than he
had used to be, and he seemed to be always
watching her, never to take his eyes off her.
She Avas rather inclined to be angry at this,
and, unless when strangers Avere present, and
good-breeding constrained her to politeness,
she would every uoav and then indulge in sharp
speeches to her cousin, or in curt ansAvers to
his questions. He had a Avay, too, of sending
for little Pierre that provoked her. It was as
if he thought she Avas not sufficiently tender
for her child. It was a tacitly conveyed lesson,
and that Avounded her. He Avould get the
child's nurse to give him into his arms, and
Avould pass a whole morning in playing Avith
him. It was under his careful teaching that
the little man first learned to stand and Avalk
steadily alone, having till then always hung on
to some protecting petticoat, and it was due
to Victor also, that the zoological utterances
of babyhood Avere transformed into a few
intelligible words.
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 225 -->

\"There," said he, one day, leading the pretty
boy up to the young Marquise, "listen to him;
he says ' Good morning, mamma,' like a
Christian; it has not taken quite a Aveek to
teach him."


Madame de ClaATeuil laughed. " Upon my
Avord, Victor," said she, "you have mistaken
your vocation; you were born' to be a
nursemaid."


\"All soldiers are," he replied. " I Avdl bet
that any man in my regiment (let alone myself)
Avill do more with a baby than a legion of
bonnes Avill. We knoAv what Ave want of the
child, and Ave've plenty of patience."


\"Whilst you naturally think Avomen have
none, and never know Avhat it is they want,"
suggested Claire.


\"Women very often do not knoAv Avhat they
want, my dear cousin," he repeated, quietly;
"it is not then* fault, but the fault of their
education."


\"Well, I knoAv that I for one like better to
hear a baby speak its baby tongue than the  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  Q
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 226 -->
prim Avords you make it repeat like a parrot,"
retorted the young Marquise.


\"I have a strong objection," added M. de
Lancour, " to anything that degrades a human
creature, even in its very earliest stage of
existence, and it is degrading to make of it
a pet animal or a plaything; a baby is not a
toy, not a thing Avhich is to amuse the people
about it."


Claire Avas silent; she thought her cousin
was in the right, but would not say so.


Just at this moment Pierre's nurse came to
fetch him for his after-breakfast airing, and
Henri Dupont came in from the garden with a
letter in his hand.


\"I have a line from Olivier," said he, trying
to look as though that wTere the most every-day
subject in the world. " He Avrites from
Homburg; he Avill be at home next week."


No one responded to this announcement,
and Avhat Avas going on before Avent on after it,
and as though it had never been made.
Madame de Clavreuil bent OArer her
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 227 -->
embroideryframe, Claire, lying back in an arm-chair.
dallied with her crotchet needles, Count Dupont
studied a newspaper, and M. de Lancour
watched the weathercock on one of the
towers of the chateau Avith seemingly intense
interest.


Half an hour later Claire and her cousin
were alone, and she, perceiving this, made a
nioA^e as though to retire also.


\"Claire," said the Vicomte, in a tone of
voice which always made her attentive, " don't
disturb yourself, pray—I am going directly,'
and he rose, " but I wrant you to answer me
one question before I go."


The young Marquise laid her Avork on one
side, and seemed prepared to obey.


\"When it is stated amongst all of you
here," he began, " that Olivier is coming
home, what does that mean ? Avhere is the
home he comes to ?"


'" Well, his OAvn, I presume," replied the
Marquise, " Beauvoisin, of course."  
  
  
  " And you. Claire ? " added Victor, but in a  
  
  
  q 2
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 228 -->
tone so gentle that it could not by possibility
excite irritation,—" and you, my cousin ? "


\"Oh! I," she replied with just a little
hesitation, " I shall stay on here with mamma.
I am so very happy here ! "


\"No ! Claire dear, you are not," interrupted
Victor tenderly, " and that is it which pains
me, pains me sincerely."


His voice Avas so kind, so affectionate, that
Claire was compelled by it, and blushing,
looked doAvn in silence.


"My dear Claire," he recommenced almost
in a Avhisper, " are you separated from your
husband ?"


\"Certainly not," Avas the answer; " hoAV
absurd! what could make you fancy such a
thing—but really after M. de Beauvoisin's
extraordinary conduct this summer, I may be
excused if I take refuge for a time Avith my
father and mother in my oAvn old home," and
then, for the first time, Claire poured forth the
story of her husband's behaviour about the
election, and the disgrace AAdiich, according to
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 229 -->
her, had been thereby entafled upon all
connected with him.


{empty}M. de Lancour listened attentively. " My
dearest cousin," said he, when she had ended
her story, " disgrace is too strong a term—
disgrace is not inflicted upon an honourable
name and family by the mere fact of one man
not precisely knowing his OAvn mind. When
you were made to marry Olivier, those who
chose him for you might have knoAvn that he
was not a genius or a man distinguished for
strength of character; but it is too late now to
mend matters—you must take him as he is,
and make the best of him; a man may become
a good honest father and head of a family, yet
have no capacity whatever for being a minister
or a parliamentary orator."


\"But his faithlessness to his engagements, to
his friends ?" interposed Claire; " it was
positively dishonourable to "


\"Hush ! hush ! dear Claire," replied the
Vicomte, " dishonour applies to worse and
sterner deeds than these—besides, look at
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 230 -->
those who might have a right to complain :
look at the Viviennes, and at Henri Dupont;
they seem to bear but small enmity to Olivier.
Why should you be more unrelenting than
they are ?"


\"It really is too bad of you ! " cried Claire,
jumping up from her seat, and, in the heat of
her annoyance, looking straight into her
cousin's face, "it is Avrong, this perpetual
defence of Avhat you knoAv to be indefensible."


"Claire!" said Victor, gravely, "Avhat is
wrong is, your perpetual Avay of making the
worst of Avhatever Olivier does : he is Pierre's
father, he Avill be your companion through
life—make the best of him, in God's name ! It
is for your OAvn sake I speak, and out of the
great affection I bear you; eveiy man has
some good points—find out his, and don't
quarrel Avith him if he refuses to gratify family
ambition; let him go his OAvn way—he has
always seemed to me inoffensive enough as far
as that goes; try to make his home and yours
happy, but don't worry his life out about
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 231 -->
politics—it's the rock many a superior Avoman
has split upon; leave him alone for the love of
mercy, and don't persecute him beyond his
bearing. He may turn out very tolerable as
times go, and yet find it totally impossible to
make of himself a politician."


Always the same advice ! always the same
monotonous defence of her husband! Claire
could not forgive her cousin for this.
<!-- Leaf 242 -->
  
  CHAPTER XIX.  
  
  
  EVERYDAY LIFE.


But the young Marquise and her cousin
were not always of different opinions every
time they met; they had in reality so many
tastes and feelings in common that, Avhen
others Avere present, and there Avas no
Avayward desire on Claire's part to be ill-natured
or aggressive towards M. de Lancour, she was
so thoroughly charming that he could not
choose but admire her cordially, and indulge
in a quite alloAvable pride in his lovely cousin.


It is mostly from these general meetings
that preferences spring, for on such occasions
Avomen especially like to shine, and even if
devoid of vanity Avish to please : Avhatever is
best in them comes out. Whereas, when two
people are alone, you can never be perfectly
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 233 -->
sure of what the hidden currents are;
diffidence, or pride, or touchiness, or a queer
perverse hostility, may so disguise them (to
themselves even, and involuntarily) that the
impression produced may be the exact reverse
of that contemplated or desired. It is only
where they are absolutely indifferent that
people are perfectly natural, and indifference is
born of and engenders nothing.


Now in society the young Marquise de
BeauAToisin had a charm that subjugated
everyone. She had read a great deal, and that in
three languages, and was possessed of a
quickness of perception and a liveliness of
imagination that made her conversation singularly
attractive, and gaAre to all she said an
incontestible originality. She was besides this a
really good musician, but upon the subject of
music she had notions of her oavu, Avhich
someAvhat stood in the way of any general
appreciation of her talents by the public. She held
music for a thing precious and delicate in the
extreme, and would not consent to regard the
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 234 -->
interpretation of a great master, or the
expression of your OAvn thought in sound, as a
mere diversion introduced to get rid of time
between a quadrille or a game of croquet.
No; upon this point Madame Claire was
obstinate, and in spite of her gentle mien, and
her soft faAvn-like eyes, nothing in the Avorld
Avould induce her to make music with those
Avho were not musicians, or for those who did
not sincerely love the art. But there Avere in
the neighbourhood of Clavreuil some few
persons Avho found grace in Claire's eyes, and so
it sometimes happened that a whole evening
would be spent in the enjoyment of Weber,
Mendelssohn, or Beethoven. Once persuaded
that kindred spirits were around her, and that
she was truly giving pleasure to her hearers,
Claire would pass hours at her piano, and
identify herself with the master-souls she
evoked. She played Chopin beautifully, for
her professor had been a Polish lady Avhose
instructor was Chopin himself; but she could
only on very rare occasions be induced to play
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 235 -->
his compositions, for she seemed to divine in
them something too painfully intimate to be
lightly indulged. She would often when alone
play Chopin half the night through, but that
was another form of self-communing in which
she much delighted, and Avhich seemed to
exercise a peculiarly calming influence over her.
Claire was not thought to be, nor did she
think herself, of a poetic temperament, but the
poetry Avithin her exacted its dues all the
same, and luckfly for her she paid her tribute.
although she did so unknowingh'. Therein
lay her charm.


This charm M. de Lancour soon felt. Like
most men of the African army, he had had
time to read and cultivate his mind, and
perhaps the very disadvantages of what, for the
last three or four years, had been his position
in society, had obliged him to create
employments for himself which made him independent
of the mere crowd out of doors. The world in
Europe generally nowadays, but aboATe all in
France, is becoming indulgent in the extreme
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 236 -->
to men who have run away with other men's
Avives, and made unto themselves eccentric
homes; but still, in spite of all this indulgence,
and even in France, where, as Ave have said, it
is greatest, there is a difference; there are
degrees in the cordiality or familiarity extended
toAvards those Avho have overstepped certain
boundaries. For instance, so long as Claire
was unmarried, her father and mother would
have only invited M. de Lancour down to
Clavreuil on special occasions, family
gatherings, when the claims of a nepheAV and first
cousin could not be overlooked. Till the
unfortunate connection Avith Madame de
Mottefort AAras a patent and public fact, Victor had
been a sort of elder brother to Claire, and
though the repugnance to the name of Lancour
Avas, as we knoAv, strong in this Legitimist
centre, the great military distinction Avon on
so many occasions by Victor, had made his
uncle and aunt proud of him personally, in
spite of every other consideration. The
terrible mistake (that was the form under which
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 237 -->
it was alluded to) committed by him in regard
to his colonel's wife, coincided with his longest
sojourn in Algeria, so that till Claire married,
she had scarcely any opportunity of remarking
that her cousin was in less familiar habits of
intimacy with her family than before.


Now that Claire was married, things wore
altogether another aspect. She depended solely
on her husband, and, if he chose that the
Vicomte de Lancour should pass all the days
of his life in his house, no one on earth had
anything to say about it. Victor's private
affairs were now tacitly ignored by everybody.
His regiment Avas garrisoned at Tours, within
a dozen leagues of everybody's chateaux, near
enough to render its presence avaflable, and far
enough off to destroy all necessity for prying
into the famdy liAres of its officers, so that the
Vicomte was accepted by the surroundings of
his new garrison as a most welcome addition
to the society of the Department. And what
became of Madame de Mottefort, where she
was, or whether, indeed, the semi-conjugal
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 238 -->
connection between her and M. de Lancour lasted
still, all this Avas, by common accord left in
darkness, and unquestioned. People agreed to
take Victor as he Avas, and he was a
remarkably agreeable, Avell brought up, highly
educated man; really distinguished, let alone the
military renown he had won, and Avore with
such charming simplicity.


It Avas quite natural that Victor should be
attracted to ClaAa'euil, it Avas so very nearly
his own home; the Comte and Comtesse de
Clavreuil Avere the nearest relations he had in
the Avorld; and, now that Claire Avas a married
Avoman—hoAvever much he might regret the
marriage that had been made for her—the fact
of her marriage alloAved of the most perfectly
familiar intercourse between him and her, and,
in his loyal and brotherly devotion to the
young Marquise, he was determined, if it were
possible, to bring her to make the best of
Olivier.


Victor w-as not long before Claire's
intellectual superiority struck and impressed him;
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 239 -->
and, as he was totally free from all
embarrassment, and all complication of thought, as far
as Claire was concerned, he sought her society
more and more Avhen others Avere around them,
and less when there Avas any chance of their
being alone, simply because he perceived that
his cousin was not always amiable with him in
the latter case, and was invariably charming in
the former.


It was seldom noAv that a day passed Avithout
the Vicomte (Avith or Avithout one or more of
his brother officers) coming over to ClaATeuil.
The regiment Avas Avell composed, and the
corps of officers consisted principally of
youngmen of birth and fortune, Avho, during the
Crimean War, had adopted many English
modes of life, and were noted for their elegant
and expensive habits.


Victor established relays of horses at his
uncle's, so that for the men A\dio had three or
four horses at command, the dozen leagues'
ride from Tours was of no consequence;
and a small detachment of the —th
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 240 -->
Dragoons Avas almost always to be found at
Clavreuil.


Another cause of intimacy sprang up soon
between M. de Lancour and his cousin. Claire
Avas not over strong in health, and old
Robichon, devoted as he was to all narrow,
antiquated French notions about his patients, could
not avoid admitting that horse exercise Avould
be beneficial. He would have preferred
SAvimming—it seemed to him more normal, as he
said—but still, as there was no river near, and
no bathing establishment anyAvhere in the
Department, he agreed to accept riding as a
substitute. He did not like it, he said, but,
at the same time, he did not deny that at
Tours he had knoAvn of cases where it had
been beneficial; true, the patients were English,
which made a great difference : Robichon
holding that the British female is a nondescript,
for Avhich nothing is suitable which regards
proper respectable Avomen—"women like
everyone else," as he termed it. However, the riding
was decided upon, and the duty of teaching
<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 241 -->
devolved upon M. de Clavreuil and upon
Victor, whose equestrian feats were renowned
even among the Arabs.


As Claire was ignorant of all fear she quickly
rode well; but attained sooner to proficiency
than to enjoyment. That the exercise did her
good, as far as health went, was undeniable;
but the set rides she was made to take under
her father's superAdsion, caused her but small
pleasure, and when she had performed about a
dozen such, varying betAveen a foot's pace,
a dignified trot, and a circumscribed canter,
she was as far as ever from understanding
what the rapture of riding could, in man or
woman, possibly be.


\"It seems to me very like what the dancing
of a minuet at court must have been," she
opined, and both M. and Mme. de Clavreuil
thought she spoke properly.


One day, toAvards the close of September
(Olivier was expected to arrive upon the
morroAv), Claire had gone to take her usual ride
with her father and cousin, when, at about  
  
  
  VOL. n. K
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 242 -->
two leagues' distance from the chateau, M. de
Clavreuil was met by his steAvard in the
dogcart, and earnestly entreated to accompany
him to an outlying farm, in which some
repairs were pressingly necessary, said the man.
Her father at first proposed to the young
Marquise to accompany him; but she had had
enough of her ride, and said, besides, that she
should be home too late, that there Avas a
dinner party, and that she must have time to
dress. The steAvard urged his request, and
Victor suggested that he might be trusted to
convey Claire back to Clavreuil, Avhich Avas
agreed to by the Count, after he had
elaborately described to his nepheAv all the various
turnings of the road he must take.


They parted : the Count going off Avith
his steAvard in one direction, and the young
Marquise, Avith her escort, preparing to take
another in order to reach her home.


The day Avas a fine one; but there had been
rain in the early morning, and the wind bleAV
from the west, an unsafe quarter.
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 243 -->

{empty}M. de. Lancour and his cousin ambled on
quietly, keeping, as they thought, to the
instructions given to them by the Count; but
at the end of half-an-hour,—


\"We must have taken a Avrong road," said
Claire; " for there to the left is the church of
Belloy Avith its double steeples—it lies on the
road to Blois, and our way goes towards the
road to Chartres."


As an excuse for Claire let it be said that,
according to the habits of her kind, she knew
no more of the country lying beyond the park
precincts of ClaArreuil than if she had been in
Central Africa; and let it also be remembered
how difficult it is to find your way in a
land all plain, wdiere between you and the
far horizon lie only the same monotonous
breadths of flat or gently undulating ground,
broAvn or green as the case may be,
intersected by small lines of road, all hopelessly
alike, and with no salient objects to guide you
as landmarks.  
  
  
  They had lost their Avay; that soon became  
  
  
  R 2
<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 244 -->
evident; and while they Avere engaged in
acknowledging this fact to themselves, the wind
began to rise and a dark shadow to steal over
the plains around them.


\"There's a shower coming on," said Claire;
\"and no shelter to be got anywhere."


\"As to shelter," replied M. de Lancour,
\"there is but one shelter in rain, my dear
Claire, and that is hard riding. If Ave can
find our Avay Ave must ride for it; that is all—
I will not be responsible for your catching an
inflammation of the lungs."


\"There, it is coming doAvn ! " cried she, as a
rain-drop or two speckled her glove; " now,
what are Ave going to do ?"


\"I'll tell you !" suddenly exclaimed Victor,
looking intently at something he descried to
the right : "we must come up with that
Avaggon out yonder; look! you can see it
moving in the distance—where that is, there's
a road—come ! " and off they went across the
fields, and as they rode, Claire folloAving her
cousin unhesitatingly, the rain began to come
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 245 -->
down steadily, the sky grew grey all over, and
the wind blew- hard.


They got near enough to see distinctly the
Avaggon Avithin a few hundred yards, it was on
a high road, and two men walked beside it.
There was a ditch between the field they were
in and the road.


\"We must jump it," said the Vicomte, and
they had jumped it before Claire kneAV what
she was doing, but she did not find it
unpleasant.


When they came up with the waggoners,
and inquired their way, they discovered that
they Avere five leagues from Clavreufl, but their
road home was no very difficult one. They
had to ride straight along that, which was the
Tours-Blois road, through tAvo villages named
to them, till they got to the turning into the
high-road from Tours to Chartres. Then, then
route was simple enough.


"It is an hour's Avork," observed Victor;
\"but nowT, Claire, we must ride in good earnest,
for the wind is cold, and you Avould be chilled
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 246 -->
in no time; give Medjd her head and trust to
her entirely."


Medjd was an Arab mare of Lancour's, that
he had lent to his cousin for her riding lessons.


Claire did simply as she Avas bid, and off
they went at a pace that evidently procured
the greatest possible enjoyment to their horses.


And this Avas the first thing that
communicated itself to Claire. She felt the joy of
the bounding animal under her, and Avas
suddenly transported into Avhat Avas like a new
element, There was a plenitude of life in it, a
healthy sense of power, that carried her aAvay
out of herself and made her feel triumphant
she knew not why, but the sensation was as of
triumph. She felt as though she were flying,
borne upwards on a cloud, or upon the crest of
a wave, or upon the wings of a bird, but
detached from earth, and so utterly secure!
She Avas too young a horseAvoman to guess at
danger, and only felt the glory and pride of
the quick rhythmic motion.  
  
  
  The rain poured down, the wind bleAV, the
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 247 -->
sky lowered, but Claire thought it all
enchanting, and never drew rein till she found herself
turning into the long avenue leading up to the
chateau.


Never had she looked so beautiful. On her
cheek Avas a bloom, and in her eye was a light
that, lovely as she had always been, made her
of a totally different beauty now.


As Victor helped her out of her saddle :
"Well done, little Claire!" said he; "why
you ride like an Amazon."


\"Oh, Victor ! " she exclaimed, naturally and
joyfully as a chfld; " that is riding; let us
have another ride like that to-morrow," and,
transformed for the moment by the strong
sensation of an innocent childish pleasure, she
looked at him as she would haA'e looked at
Henri Dupont, or any one comparatively
indifferent to her, and Avas in fact absorbed by the
thoroughly new joy that she had just tasted.


\"Get aAvay as fast as you can," urged
Lancour; " and change your clothes from head to
foot—you're drenched to the skin."
<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 248 -->
  
  
\"Never mind that," she replied,
laughing; " only promise me such another ride
tomorroAV—it's absolutely divine ! " And on
receiving his promise, readily giAren, she
darted indoors.
<!-- Leaf 259 -->
  
  CHAPTER XX.  
  
  
  THE BALL.


This gallop through the rain produced so
strong an impression upon the young Marquise
that for the next few days her wdiole mode
of being seemed modified. She, who was
habitually so quiet as to be almost grave, was
now possessed by the love of actiA'e
movement; and she whose chief occupations had
been sedentary and intellectual, was learning
to feel all the exhilarating influence of exercise
in the open air.


Madame de Clavreuil was, if the truth must
be told, just a trifle shocked at the change in
Claire's manners, and she was terribly afraid
of her so perfectly well-trained daughter and
pattern for young French wives becoming
inoculated with the dreadful fast habits of
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 250 -->
EnglishAvomen — of those boisterous,
hoydenish persons of whom she had heard and
read, but of Avhom she thanked heaven she
had never counted one in her oavii individual

acquaintance.


There Avas a buoyancy noAV in Claire that
added a fresh and altogether a different charm
to the charms for which she had hitherto been
remarkable. It Avas for the most part a purely
physical modification she Avas undergoing; it
was the sudden and healthy assertion of a force
as yet undeveloped within her; but the mental
portion of it existed too, and this led her to
feel that for the first time she had found a
genuine distraction. She kneAV uoav of a real
remedy for discouragement and despondency,
kneAV that there Avas a means by Avhich she
could momentarily escape from the pressure of
sad thoughts; and she resorted to it eagerly.


There awoke in Claire de Beauvoisin that
Avhich lies dormant in every Avell-constituted
healthy human creature, namely, the thirst for
life. She longed to live, to feel, to enjoy, to
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 251 -->
test the power of being within her, and to prove
upon herself her oavu capacity of Aitality. She
Avas not the first upon whom the passion of
riding has seized in such a conjuncture, not the
first to whom the " rapture of riding " has been
a refuge.


Every day was devoted by the young
Marquise to a riding party, and I am sorry to have
to record that the minuet-like performances of
the Count, her father, were somewhat
undutifully set aside. Claire rode for riding's sake,
rode hard, and for the love of the mad rush
through the air; Avhilst to her father
ridingwas an art, and he practised it correctly, never
violating rules or precepts. M. de Clavreuil
Avould still accompany his daughter in her
{empty}.excursions, but as she now mostly surrounded
herself Avith comparatively unscientific caA'aliers
—men whose school had been the fantasia of
Arab chiefs—the Count was unceremoniously
left to his haute ecole, and distanced by the
irregulars of Claire's cavalry.  
  
  
  The day after the young Marquise's
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 252 -->
memorable ride in the rain, Olivier arrived, and
though his adArent Avas palpably indifferent to
his Avife, yet, Avoman-like (I Avon's attempt to
deny it), she took advantage of his coming
to get her neAV enjoyment sanctioned, and she
Avas content that her husband should be one
of her constant attendants, because, as her
husband, his presence authorised any excess of
equestrianism she might choose to commit.


This again Avas a little bit of unconscious
dishonesty on Claire's part, Avho Avas otherAvise
the most loyal, honest, conscientious person
breathing : she knew that her sudden taste for
horse exercise would please Olivier beyond
description, and she meant to profit by this
disposition of his, Avithout in the slightest
degree rewarding him for it. These are the
small moral frauds committed by the best and
most exemplary Avomen, and for Avhich, as
education and society are at present organised,
no one has the least right to blame them.


But life blossomed forth in Claire upon all
points at once. She expressed more promptly
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 253 -->
and Aigorously Avhatever impression she
received. When she drew, her strokes were
more masterly; when she played, her touch
was more full of soul; when she spoke, her
words illumined her thought instantaneously—
life, in short, Avas brimful in her, and running
over. There has probably never been man or
woman to whom this has not once happened,
only neither they nor those around them may
have noted it.


The Department had been busy with several
events during the last three wTeeks. There had
been races at Tours and at Blois, and
agricultural meetings at Malleray and at Brunoy,
besides private fetes at different chateaux,
amongst which the shooting matches at Mont
Viviermp. had shone conspicuous. It was not
only because these latter festivities were upon
the most magnificent scale, and constituted an
innovation in a French province, that they
created such a sensation; it was also because
they were said to be giA^en on account of an
event which would be of the greatest
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 254 -->
importance to the whole district, the approaching
marriage, namely, of the Due de ViAienne's
only daughter Avith her cousin Gaston. And
the report proved true, and by degrees the two
families (both established at Mont Vivienne)
confided the project discreetly to their intimate
friends, and it Avas known that on the fifteenth
of October (St. Theresa's Feast) the
weddingceremony would take place at the residence of
the bride's father, and be celebrated with little
short of regal splendour. Meanwhile, this
beeame a motive for fresh gaieties, and what
were called the leading families vied with each
other in offering fetes to the future bride and
bridegroom and their parents.


A ball was decided upon at ClaAreud;
imitations were distributed all over the
Department, and gladly accepted. All vexation
consequent upon the failure of the electoral
projects of the summer having apparently Avorn
away, the whole clan of the Viviennes
promised to come to Clavreuil, as much almost as
the guests of M. de Beauvoisin and his wife,
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 255 -->
as of the actual proprietors of the place, for
the certain date of OliAier's return was duly
ascertained before the day for the ball was
definitively fixed.


Claire put the same animation into her
preparations for this entertainment as she did now
into everything she undertook, and anticipated
seemingly a larger amount of enjoyment from
it than from any of the magnificent receptions
which, in Paris, left her more or less
indifferent.


The night of the ball came, and with it
every indiAidual of any note or standing for
twenty or thirty miles round. People came
from Blois, from Chartres, and from Tours,
and the chateaux of the frontier departments
contributed their quota of fair women and
dancers, wdio AA'Ould consent to dance. Of
what in England would be termed the county
society, no one faded; of the official world,
the Preset and Receveur-Gdndral only had been
invited (and that by a quite unusual
concession on M. de Clavreuil's part); but neither
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 256 -->
of them chose to come, not caring to risk their
dignity as government functionaries in the
midst of an assemblage of persons Avhose
importance Avas derived from their birth and
social standing, and Avhose proficiency in all
the delicate arts and wiles of insolent politeness
Avas proverbial.


Military authorities, on the contrary, Avere
to be met on all sides, and not a general or
colonel who commanded within any possible
distance had been omitted from the list of the
invited, or had neglected to profit by the
invitation.


Clavreuil Avas Avanting in anything that could
be called splendour, but it had that Avhich,
aided by the decorative taste of the French,
suffices for all the purposes of splendour,
namely, space. The chateau dated from the
time of Henri IV., and between its tAvo
enormous square toAvers at each end, and the
eight-windowed corps de logis Avhich connected
them, there was a ground floor containing vast
lofty halls, and rooms in which six or seven
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 257 -->
hundred people could have been easily
entertained, without counting the broad and very
handsome stone terrace, approached from each
side by a flight of ten or twelve steps, and on
which the ground floor window's to the front
all opened. With the help of flowers and
lights, both employed to profusion, the interior
of the chateau of Clavreufl, on the night of the
ball, looked exceedingly well, and presented
all the external aspects requisite to what is
denominated by those bidden to it a
magnificent fete.


\"How surprisingly lovely Claire is to-night,"
said Madame Beaudouin to her sister-in-law,
Madame de ClaAT:eufl. Madame Beaudouin
had arrived two days before, to her niece's
great delight.


And Madame Beaudouin was right, nothing
more beautiful than the young Marquise could
be imagined. She was very simply dressed,
and moved about in her creamy folds of soft
muslin like a young immortal cloud enswathed.
It is true that if the simplicity of appearance  
  
  
  VOL. II. S
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 258 -->
was extreme, that did not mean that the cost
of such simplicity was small, for the
Valenciennes which trimmed the muslin Avas lace of
a hundred francs a yard, and twenty yards at
least had been required. The price Avas dear,
but the taste Avas pure—which is all that
should noAv be asked from FrencliAvomen. For
her head-dress Claire wore only one large pale
straAV-tinted rose, Avith its long- thick bud and
its dark-green waxy-looking leaves and
thornless stalk : and the masses of her superb hair
tAvined and rolled themselves in plaits and
tresses round her head, or escaped in curls
and Avaves light and cloud-like as the folds of
her dress.


Madame de Clavreuil watched her daughter
Avith satisfaction, but a satisfaction mixed, as
it seemed, with anxiety, lest Claire should, in
her animation, overstep the boundaries which,
by immutable custom, hedged in the demeanour
of women of her high rank and spotless
reputation. Madame Beaudouin, on the contrary,
grew joyful with Claire's joy, and brightened
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 259 -->
as her every glance folloAved her much loved
niece about.


"As usual, my Claire is the queen of the
fete," said she fondly to the young Marquise,
as the pause in a waltz brought the latter close
to her.


Claire turned round, and, putting her arm
round her aunt's waist, with a sudden and
indescribably graceful movement, " You will
always spoil me, Aunt Clementine !" she
exclaimed, imprinting a kiss on Madame
Beaudouin's cheek.


\"Child ! chfld ! " cried the latter, laughing;
\"what will all the solemn set say ?"


\"Oh; never mind, aunt, dear! " pleaded
Claire; "I never amused myself before."


\"And you really are amusing yourself now,
my darling ?" replied Madame Beaudouin,
tenderly, and surveying gladly the
rosebloom of her niece's cheek, and the
radiance of the smile in her eyes and on her
lips.  
  
  
  " I think so," answered Claire, as she floated  
  
  
  s 2
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 260 -->
away again into the midst of the waltz Avith
her partner.


Yes ! Claire thought this Avas really pleasure,
and she gave herself up to it, as she had done
to the bounding strides of her horse, the first
time she had ridden freely and unhindered
through unenclosed space.


Claire did not knoAv that what had seized
upon her and was whirling her along was
merely excitement, a word Avhereof she ignored
the sense. But as life Avas strong Avithin her,
and she had had feAV of the aims for which life
is spent, she readily abandoned herself to the
current which offered to transport her.


The lights, the perfume of the flowers, the
music, the admiration she called forth, all
combined to heighten in Claire a sense of
enjoyment she had never before experienced; and
for the first time (she must be forgiA'en for she
knew not what she did), for the first time she
felt a strong irresistible, wish to charm M. de
Lancour, to produce upon him an impression
that should still leave her unharmed and to all
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 261 -->
appearance unconscious, but shoidd disturb the
placidity of his purely fraternal feelings for
her. Of course this was very wrong on Claire's
part, and I am not going to excuse her for it,
but so it Avas. The one idea that drove her
onwards, that, vague and undefined, subjected
her involuntarily—-was the idea of making her
cousin Victor in love Avith her ! There Avas
no premeditation in all this, no malice
prepense, no lack of virtue; there was the sudden
aAArakening of the eternal feminine instinct in a
creature full of undirected life.


Nicely scrutinised, it Avould have been seen
that at that identical moment Claire Wed
Victor less than she had ever done before, but
she aspired to dominion over him : to an
illdefined sort of power that, as I said before,
was not to hurt her but only him; and not
seriously to hurt either, for he Avas only for an
hour to be passionately in love Avith her, and
then forget all about it.


The truth is, that Claire's beauty and
animation were such on that night, that everyone
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 262 -->
present Avas impressed. Henri Dupont raved
loudly about her, Gaston de Vivienne (Avhen
his future Avas not Avithin earshot) declared
that she was the loveliest woman in all France;
and even her own sex were agreed upon her
extreme loveliness, only they said that she
kneAV it (which always seems to be a great
crime in their eyes), and that her manners
were not quiet enough, Avhich seemed to afford
them consolation.


Olivier had for the last hour been watching
his beautiful wife from a seat in one of the
AvindoAvs. Between a polka that had just
finished, and a Avaltz that Avas about to
commence, he, after much apparent hesitation,
came up to her.


\"May I take one tour de valse with you,
Claire ?" he said, timidly.


She Avas standing in the midst of a group of
admirers, biting daintily Avith her dazzling
teeth and ruby lips at the floAvers in her
bouquet of tea-roses. When he spoke, she
lowered the hand that held the nosegay, and
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 263 -->
crossed it on the other snoAvy hand and arm.
looking queenly.


\"Monsieur le Marquis," said she, with
dignified grace, and smiling radiantly, " I really
cannot alloAV you to incur such ridicule as that!
No husband waltzes with his wife."


Olivier bowed and retired, not Avithout
eAident embarrassment, for he was evidently
pained. Later in the evening, M. de Lancour
petitioned for a wraltz. Claire absolutely flashed
Avith brilliancy, as though sunbeams Avere
running in her veins, and then Avith a
ringinglaugh no one ever heard her laugh before or
since,—


"My dear Victor!" she retorted, "you do
not know how to waltz ! "


At these words (which Avere true; M. de
Lancour did dance very badly, and therefore
seldom danced at all), a shout of laughter
came from all around, in which Victor himself
most frankly and good-humouredly joined.


"Quite right, Claire," he answered; "but
really you are so omnipotent to-night, that you
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 264 -->
make one forget oneself altogether, and
whatsoever one knoAvs or does not knoAv;—perhaps,
Avhile looking at you, I fancied I should be
inspired all at once, and turn out a
prizeAvaltzer ! " And this was said with an
admiration and a familiarity felt to be alloAvable
betAveen tAvo people brought up as brother and
sister. There Avas nothing more.


A little later M. de Lancour seated himself
beside the Duchesse de Varignan, who had
come over with the party from Mont-Vivienne,
Avhere she Avas staying. She rarely danced,
for she thought one of her great charms lay in
the fulness and roundness of her outlines, and
that too quick movements did not show her
off to advantage. She seemed to be making
herself vastly agreeable to M. de Lancour, for
he remained till supper-time by her side,
chatting and laughing unceasingly; and after
supper, while the cotillon Avas at its height,
Claire saAv her cousin Victor cross the
ballroom, giving his arm to the Duchesse, and
guide her towards the terrace, Avhere, under
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 265 -->
the flower-filled awning that had been erected,
they could continue their conversation
probably more at their ease.


Claire's gladness was all gone. She
wondered how she came to refuse to waltz with
her cousin. What could have prompted her,
Claire de Beauvoisin, of whom no one had
ever spoken lightly, to such a piece of
underbred flippancy ? What business had she to
indulge in such a silly, vnlgar, schoolgirl-like
triumph ? A triumph that ? What must
Victor think of her ? What could it possibly
matter Avhether he danced ill or well ?


Poor Claire! her little hour of fluttering
coquetry was past, and she felt singularly sad.
<!-- Leaf 276 -->

  A STARTLING FACT.


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin had been hurt by Avhat

perhaps be able to understand, and far more
so than he himself could by any means account
for.

no more than that), and to Avhom he Avas
tolerably indifferent; a man who had been
caught in the toils of a Travdata, and Avho,
from many causes, and whether he liked it or
not, Avas on that side inextricably entangled;
yet who, because his oavu Avife was beautiful
and admired, Avas suddenly seized Avith the
desire to profit by the circumstance that
legally he Avas her husband. A Aveek before,
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 267 -->
he Avas behaving as though Claudine had
charms for him, behaving in a way to make
her imagine that he cared for her. Aided by
our sagacious friend, Aspasie, Olivier had
surrounded this intrigue Avith impenetrable
secresy, but Olivier wras Claudine's Lwer all
the same; that Avas a fact, and not to be
denied. Another equally patent fact was, that
in all M. de BeauAToisin's whole being there
Avas not one quality wThich could enable him to
appreciate Claire, or lead him to be impressed
by her excellencies. They had nothing in
common; he kneAV it, and had avoAved it to
Henri Dupont. Yes; but that was quite in
the beginning, Avhen they Avere really very
distant one from the other, and when it seemed
the natural consequence of marriages such as
theirs that they should be so. But since then
there had intervened the little episode Ave
knoAv of touching the election, and Olivier had
felt how pleasant it was to be on terms of
cheerful kindly familiarity Avith his pure
radiant Avife. It had raised him in his oaati
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 268 -->
opinion; it Avas pleasant beyond anything he
had eA^er experienced. But it was over. For
ever over. Well! Olivier's, Avhich was a very
ordinary nature, "got the better," as it is
called (though the truer expression would be
"got the AA-orse"), of all this, and when,
having decided to try the distractions of
German watering-places, he found the Sphinx
in the same toAvn with himself, he quietly
reverted to the habits he had suspended, not
broken off, and managed to pass his time in a
sort of imitation " affair of the heart."


But Avhen he came back and saAv Claire in
the new phase of her beauty, it was her
beauty only that struck him, and this was
altogether a neAV situation to him, and he
could not quite understand it. When M. de
BeauA'oisin made up his mind to ask his Avife
for just one turn of a Avaltz, he had lost sight
completely of the high-minded sovereign lady
to whose approbation and perhaps even
affection he had been, a few months previously, so
pleased to fancy he might aspire, and whose
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 269 -->
resentment had so lowered him in his OAvn
esteem. Her refusal now wounded him in a
very complex manner; and at the end of a few
moments M. de Beauvoisin left the ball-room,
and bent his steps towards the staircase leading
to the first floor. As he was crossing the
billiard-room, wdiich was empty, he Avas met
by M. de Moranges, who had come from Paris
two days before on purpose to be present at
the ball at Clavreuil


\"I've had enough of it all," said Olivier.
\"Do you find it amusing ? "


\"Not I," responded his uncle. " I've had
enough, like you; only one does not know
where to go in these cases. When people
haATe turned their houses out at Avindows, there
is too much noise to think of sleeping, and
nobody has anything to say to one; if you
happen to have a taste for roaming about in
the gardens, and looking at the moon, you
may escape that way, but if not "


\"Well," interposed Olivier, " I Avas making
off to the smoking-room "  
  
  
  r
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 270 -->
  
  " I never smoke," retorted M. de Moranges.


\"Will you sup ?" said his nephew; " I'll
order a cold foAvl into my room up-stairs, and
Ave can have some of that Chateau Yquem we
had at dinner."


{empty}M. de Moranges agreed, and Olivier
havingtaken the measures necessary for ensuring their
repast, the uncle and nepheAV adjourned to a
room on the second-floor, which was given up
to the Marquis de Beamroisin as a salon in
A\diich to receive his friends.


They supped, though, as it AATould seem,
neither Avith much appetite; but to the Chateau
Yquem they did honour.


\"Oh! life is such a bore," at length said
Olivier, in ansAver to some remark of his uncle's,
\"that the Avonder to me is how one does
manage to get through day after day."


\"A bore ?" repeated M. de Moranges, " that
I should not quite say; a take in, yes ! a
mistake," he added, after a pause of a second, " a
complete mistake."  
  
  
  
\"God knows it is a blank to me !" rejoined
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 271 -->
his nepheAV; and then, hopelessly, and
throAVing himself back in his chair, and examining
the ceiling; "I give you my honour I don't
knoAv what to make of it; I can find nothing
to do AAith my time."


\"That may possibly be because you have
nothing to do," suggested the uncle, Avith a
gentle irony that was Avholly unperceived by
his interlocutor; " but it cannot be denied that
you have everything in life which, according
to preachers and moralists, ought to make you
enjoy it; I Avon's speak of position or wealth,
(that would be styled wTorldly!) but wdiat
a home!" (Olivier ran two fingers drearily
through his curly fair hah), " what a mother!"
(OliAier Avinced), " and what a wife! there is
not another like her !"


OliAier rose from the table, went to the open
Avindow, gave a stare at the moonlit landscape,
and turning round, " Don't let us speak of
Claire," said he, moodily; " Claire hates me."


{empty}M. de Moranges did not appear horrified or
even startled by this announcement; he swept
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 272 -->
a feAV crumbs from the tablecloth with his little
finger, and, after a pause of a second or two,
\"Hate is probably too much," he remarked;
\"she may not love you; but if you do not
loAre her, it is not of much consequence. Do
you love your wife, OliAier ?"


Olivier was completely taken off his balance
by the question; such a quantity of
conflictingthoughts and images rose up all at once in his
brain, that he stared in stupid silence at the
questioner.


\"There are those who declare love, I mean
pure, moral, domestic love, wedded love if you
will, to be the secret of happiness," continued
{empty}M. de Moranges; " if it be so, you seem to me
to be in the best possible condition for proving
it; never had husband so adorable a wife; but
that means nothing, for love is quite
unreasonable."


These last words were uttered in a tone that
Avas not Avithout sadness.


\"Uncle," exclaimed Olivier, seemingly
perplexed in the extreme; " I don't knoAv myself
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 273 -->
hoAv it stands between Claire and me. I haA^e
always let her have her own way in everything,
and we seemed to be on the best and politest
terms; but somehoAV, in the main, wTe never
really got on together. It isn't worth thinking
of now; but some months ago I fancied Claire
could really like me, and " he stopped and
breathed hard; " well, as I say, it's no matter
now—that's all over, and she hates me."


\"And you would love her if she Avould let
you ? " observed his uncle.


Olivier, Avithout replying, merely looked
steadfastly at M. de Moranges, who returned
the gaze.


"At all events, you are convinced she cares
for no one else ?" and the tone in which this
was spoken was a singular one.


\"She is too cold and too proud to loATe at
all," was M. de Beauvoisin's rejoinder, and
there was a shade of bitterness in it.


{empty}M. de Moranges leant his head upon his
hand, and appeared plunged in thought.
Gradually his look fixed itself upon his  
  
  
  VOL. II. r
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 274 -->
nephew, and, biting his nether lip, and, busy
as it seemed Avith some internal problem he
could not solve,—


\"Olivier," said he, " Avill you do me a
serAice ? I think I can trust you."


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin started, for the voice that
addressed him Avas unlike that he knew; it
Avas the voice of a man Avith an unsteady purr
pose, or Avho is a prey to some great anxiety—
both were unlike his reckless Don Juan of an
uncle.


\"Trust me to the death—I Avill do Avhatever
you ask me," ansAvered Olivier, Avith a
semblance of animation quite unnatural to him,
and produced by a vague apprehension he
could not account for.


\"You saw a great deal of Claudine at
Homburg, did you not ?" asked M. de Moranges;
\"saAv her nearly every day, and every
evening ?" Luckily the uncle did not look at his
nephew Avhile addressing him, for the latter
grew suddenly so pale that he must have been
struck by it; but his own question appeared
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 275 -->
to fill him with embarrassment, and he spoke
indistinctly, hurriedly, and low.


\"I saw her often; yes," rejoined Olivier,
trying to look unconcerned, " more of a day
than of an evening."  
  
  
  " And of an evening she received others ?"


\"I think so—I am not sure—Yes! I think
she received sometimes—." (M. de Beauvoisin
was at a loss to discover what his uncle was
driving at.)


There was another pause, M. de Moranges
supported his head upon his left arm, with his
right hand he drew patterns on the tablecloth.


\"Did Florestan de Nesves stay there all the
time ? " he at last inquired


OliAier breathed more freely, and the colour
came back to his cheeks.


\"I don't belieA^e Nesves was there at all," he
objected.


{empty}M. de Moranges fixed a very keen look full
upon his nephew.


\"Olivier, be true to me—don't go over to
the other side," he said, with an expression of  
  
  
  T 2
<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 276 -->
countenance not precisely reassuring; "I am
all but certain he was there—I could almost
SAvear to it."


\"But, you knoAv, I Avas not at Homburg the
whole time—I Avent over to Baden very often,
and at last staid there; besides, my dear uncle,"
(he Avas getting bold noAv), " Avhat jealousy
could you have of ?"  
  
  
  i"


"Jealousy?" echoed his uncle, trying to look
proud and indifferent, " jealousy ! Avho talks of
jealousy ? I should think not, indeed—but I
A\ill not have her ill spoken of—and I have
my reasons for what I say, and that is why I
have decided to trust you. Just listen to this :
last July I was in Paris, and came home one
night earlier from the club than was my wont;
the date is fixed in my memory, it was the 6 th.
Instead of going up the great staircase, I went
through the ground-floor rooms, to the spiral
staircase from the library to the first-floor—the
Avindow of the morning-room was open to the
garden, and on the laAvn I saw the shadoAv of a
man going down the walk toAvards the garden
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 277 -->
gate. The man himself was hidden. I am
certain that man was Florestan de Nesves."


\"And—you did not attempt—you did not
think of—following him ? " M. de Beauvoisin's
heart beat so strongly, that he found it difficult
to articulate clearly.


\"No !" was the reply in a whisper. " I
neither followed, nor questioned—but I have
tried to watch narrowly ever since. If I were
your age, Olivier, I would not mind people
guessing; but, at mine, one must avoid ridicule."  
  
  
  " But why should you suspect Nesves ? "


\"Who else should it be ? He admires her
eAidently."


\"Well, my dear uncle, I Avill devote myself
to your service," assured M. de Beauvoisin;
\"you Avish me to discover whether there really
is any cause for supposing that matters have  
  
  
  gone too far betwTeen Madame Claudine and

Nesves ?"  
  
  
  " I do," murmured M. de Moranges.


\"I cannot help thinking you avUI find out
there is nothing at all."
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 278 -->

A sudden and fervent " God grant it!"
escaped from his uncle's lips.


\"And, if the worst comes to the worst," he
added, trying to assume an off-hand air, " Avhy
for a man like you, the loss of such a woman
as that could be of no consequence."


\"We need not speculate on the AA^orst,"
replied Moranges. " I may be mistaken—I

would not wrong her."


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin was lost in a maze, andf
utterly ignorant of Avhat a passion of this kind
may make, at fifty-five, of a man Avho has
never loved, he shoAved the surprise he felt.


\"My dignity requires that I should knoAv
the truth," observed M. de Moranges, acting
up to the last to Avhat had been the part played
through life.


\"But if the truth were AAdiat Ave -will hope
it is not ?" suggested OliAier, not very well
knoAving Avhat to say.


The look that for a moment passed over his
uncle's features was one that could not be
forgotten Avhen once seen. It Avas a pitiful
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 279 -->
combat between anguish and pride, and even
the opaque perception of Olivier seized the fact
of its being a fife and death struggle in the
soul of his uncle. As the latter stood before
him now, ten years seemed to have been added
to his age.


No further word was uttered, but M. de
Beauvoisin recognised Avith considerable
dismay the danger into which Claudine's passion
for him was leading him. A gulf was yawning
at his feet, and for the present he saw safety
noAvhere.


At fifty-fiAre ! the hardest liver of the epoch !
Was this the vengeance Love took for
half-acentury of scorn ?


For the moment OliAier forgot all about
Claire, and his OAvn feeling of perpetual
boredom in life.
<!-- Leaf 290 -->
  
  CHAPTER XXII.  
  
  
  LOVE, THE SAME IN ALL.


There was strength in Claire, and,
therefore, she suffered strongly. Partly from
ignorance, partly from excitement, she had been
led into behaving as it was not natural to her
to behave—into doing that Avhich was most
contrary to her character, to her habits of life
—in a Avord, to her whole self. This happens
more frequently to us all than we are inclined
to admit, and is the cause of severe vexation
of spirit.


Had Claire been unfriendly to M. de
Lancour, had she treated him with coldness or
discourtesy, with haughtiness or disdain, she
would not have minded (she had, as we know,
shown him anything but cordiality since her
marriage), but she could not forgive herself
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 281 -->
for behaving towards him in a manner that it
was unbecoming for her, Claire de Beauvoisin,
to assume; a manner that—coolly reflected
upon—must be to him inexplicable, and for
which she had, at the bottom of her heart, but
one explanation, humiliating in the extreme.


Claire—the pure, refined, high-minded Claire
—she who, whateArer happened, Avas
determined that, to the end of time, her cousin
should look up to her in his memory as to a
bright, particular star—she had carried herself
after the fashion of some shopkeeper's daughter
(or worse), and had actually paraded a want of
breeding, a stupid levity that, unless through
the action of temporary insanity, it Avas
impossible to conceive in her. She had been
coquettish, frivolous, flippant, and for AAThat ?
She kneAV, but dared 'not own. It Avas like a
dream. And the penalty incurred ? from that
she turned in indescribable dread. Victor,
whose notions about women (notions have
nothing to do with actions) were so strict—■
what wrould his judgment be upon her ?
<!-- Leaf 292, Page: 282 -->

Nor was that all. There Avas Avorse still.
Worse ? could Avorse then be ? There was a
last deep pit of anguish to Avhich Claire, if she
descended, Avent alone and in the dark. She
shrank from seeing Avhat was there to hurt
her, but she smarted from the pain.


After a sleepless night, Claire, on the
morroAV of the ball, sought her one comforter
in all trouble, Madame Beaudouin, and, when
the occupations of the forenoon were over, the
aunt and niece strolled forth together into the
park.


The day was balmy and bright, and the
deep A'erdure of summer was only here and
there yielding to the more gorgeously varied
autumn tints. Madame Beaudouin loved
nature Avith an almost passionate intensity,
and Avas an indefatigable Avalker. The two
strayed beyond the limits of Clavreuil,
talkinglittle, but seemingly taking pleasure in the
mere fact of each other's society.


The last words that had been exchanged on
the previous night between Madame Beaudouin
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 283 -->
and Claire had been AA*ords of joyfulness on
the latter's part. The bloom upon her cheek
and the light in her eye were matched by the
gladsome ring of her young voice, as she had
said, " I never amused myself before !"


Why was it Madame Beaudouin felt that all
this was altered, and that a shadowT had fallen
over her niece's joyous mood ? She could not
haA'e told you, but the proof that she so felt
was that she spoke to Claire upon indifferent
subjects only, and did not even allude to the
fete of the previous night.


They reached the edge of a road, on the
other side of which was a considerable
plantation of pines and larches, fine, stoutly-growing
young trees. They crossed the plantation, and
emerged upon a common overgrown with
gorse and furze; a few hundred yards in front
the ground gaA^e a sudden dip, and beyond
that the smoke curling up from a chimney
shoAved that you were on the edge of a small
valley.  
  
  
  " This is about the only picturesque bit in
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 284 -->
the whole country," said Madame Beaudouin,
\"or, at least, in the Clavreuil portion of it;
there runs the Savre at the bottom of that
little ravine, and the smoke you see comes
from the cottage by Mathurin's mill."


She walked on, folloAved by Claire, till they
reached the spot Avhere the ground clipped
doAvn toAvards the river, and, compared Avith
the rest of the flat bare landscape, this
certainly was, as Madame Beaudouin had said,
jiicturesque.


Madame Beaudouin proposed to sit and rest
awhile, and Avhen her niece had seated herself
by her side, " Claire," she asked; "do you
mean to say that you have forgotten this
place ?"


\"Well," replied the young Marquise,
hesitatingly; " I fancy I remember it faintly, but I
could not have found my Avay here. Mathurin
is the Clavreuil miller, is he not ?"


"To be sure," murmured Madame
Beaudouin, thoughtfully, and as though speaking
to herself, " nine years, at your age, constitute
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 285 -->
nearly half a life! but don't you remember a
picnic that was got up here for you, Claire ? it
Avas in the month of July, after your first
communion. You took your first communion in
Paris in May, and we all came cIoavu here in
June. I spent the whole of that summer at
Clavreuil. Don't you remember that, to please
you, we arranged a picnic at Mathurin's mill
doAAm there, and you amused yourself so
immensely, that, in the evening, driving home
betAveen your mother and me, you did nothing
but repeat, over and over, that, in all your life
to come, it was impossible you could ever
amuse yourself so much again ? I remember
it all as if it was yesterday."


\"I think I do remember it," said Claire, in
a low tone, and turning away her head.


Alas! they who love, and think they know
us best, never know what they disturb when
they begin to rake about amongst our old
memories. From the day of that very identical
picnic at Mathurin's mill, had dated Claire's
first serious preoccupation of spirit touching
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 286 -->
her cousin Victor. She Avas a child not yet
twelve, he had been tAvo years an officer, and
Avas just home from Algeria to recover from a
wound.


Claire sat still and silent, drifting back into
the past and comparing it Avith the present,
till, absorbed in her own personal troubles, she
lost sight of certain small fitnesses and
gradations, and, A\ithout any transition Avhatever,—


\"Aunt," said she, abruptly, " Avhat is it
people see in Elise de Varignan ? What charm
can she possibly have for men ? "


Claire Avas jealous, and one quarter of an
hour's genuine jealousy Avill make more havoc
in a human mind (no matter hoAv Avell
regulated) than Avill a AAdiole twelvemonth of
hopeless hidden love.


Madame Beaudouin bent forAvard, and
laying her hand gently on her niece's shoulder,—


"Are you quite sure, my darling," said she,
in reply to the question so abruptly put, " are
you quite sure that Madame de Varignan has
the charm you speak of?"
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 287 -->
  
  Claire blushed, and looked confused.


\"Why," she retorted, " only look at Olivier!"
(as if he, poor felloAv, had anything at all to do
in the case !) " Look at them all," she added,
\"those bold, brazen ways of hers seem to
fascinate them."


\"She is more than merely bold, she is
coarse," observed the aunt.


\"Well! " rejoined the niece, bitterly, " I
suppose it is that that causes her success ?"


\"Don't be led into thinking that, my
Claire," responded Madame Beaudouin gravely,
\"it is the greatest mistake imaginable; all men
have a horror of coarseness in women; they
put up with it, because they can't help
themselves, and because they can't put it down;
but they recofi from it—nay, recoil from it
so strongly that they become invulnerable.
Coarse women make a loveless age—like  
  
  
  :>

ours.


Claire relapsed into silence, and sat by the
side of Aunt Clementine, gazing in mute
dreaminess at the peaceful scene before her.
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 288 -->
The rays of the sun lay palely golden upon
the vine-clad rising ground on the other side
of the river; the heavens were all one sheet of
delicate blue, AAith here and there a streak of
milk-white cloud; all Avas hushed around, save
for the faint ripple of the AATater over its reedy
bed; and the only trace of active life Avas to
be found in the aspect of a team of oxen yoked
to a cart, and standing motionless in a distant
field, their outlines darkly draAvn against the
clear evening sky. Aunt Clementine absorbed
delightedly the calm of all around her : Claire
did not. It rather oppressed her.


Five o'clock Avas struck by some church bell
far off, and floated, as it Avere, A\Thisperingly
across the plains. Madame Beaudouin
suggested the propriety of returning homewards,
for they had more than an hour's Avalk before
them. They quickened their pace, but once
again they spoke little. As they recrossed the
pine and larch plantation and approached the
road, they heard voices and the tread of
horses' hoofs. When they stepped upon the
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 289 -->
road, they perceived three horsemen close
behind them : Henri Dupont, M. de Lancour,
and a brother officer of the latter's.


Lively greetings were exchanged, and the
remainder of the way back to ClaAreuil was
undertaken together; the equestrians escorting
the young Marquise and her aunt. Naturally,
the subject of conversation was the fete of
the night before; and each one had some
remark to offer, or some incident to relate.
Claire put on the mask which society decided
she had to wear, assumed the part it was
her business to perform, and was charming
and graceful, pleasant and what, in a lesser
woman, might be called chatty, but she was
not her own self.


\"Gaston de Vivienne has wonderfully
improved," observed Madame Beaudouin.


\"He's a very fine fellow," added Henri
Dupont; " and has in him the stuff of a man
beyond the ordinary run."


\"If the world—his world, I mean—don't
spoil it all," remarked Victor.  
  
  
  VOL. II. C
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 290 -->

\"He'll grow too large," opined Victor's
brother officer.


\"Herminie is quife delightful," said Claire;
\"not exactly handsome, but thoroughly
charming. I don't knoAv when I've seen so nice a
girl."


\"Well, they call it a love-match," resumed
Henri Dupont.


\"Ah !" dropped from Claire's lips, almost
unconsciously.


\"So I had heard," added Aunt Cldmentine;
\"and I confess that made me look at them
with interest. I am inclined to believe it is
true, and that they are very much attached to
each other."


\"Peste ! " ejaculated the young officer;
\"they have no complaint to make of fortune.
Birth, rank, Avealth, good looks, and a
lovematch to croAvn all! Tavo millions a year,
and Mont-Vivienne, and the wife you've
chosen for yourself! I must say I call that
too much."  
  
  
  " It certainly is a prodigious case of
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 291 -->
suitableness in marriage," observed Henri
Dupont.


"Perhaps," said M. de Lancour. "But I
confess I have an objection to marriages
between cousins."


\"What an odd idea!" retorted his brother
officer. " And for what earthly reason ?
Nothing is more common, now-a-days—it keeps
property together. Why shouldn't cousins
marry l.


\"They do marry every day," repeated Victor;
\"but I can only say that, in a general AAray,
I don't think a marriage between cousins a
good thing."  
  
  
  v 2
<!-- Leaf 302 -->
  
  CHAPTER XXIII.  
  
  
  LOVE STRONG IN DEATH.


A fortnight passed, and every day brought
the young Marquise together Avith her cousin;
mostly, too, amongst other people, so that it
was seldom that Claire was seen otherwise than
to her great and marked advantage.


There was, however, again a change in her.
She had relapsed afresh into her old cpiiet
ways, and Madame de Clavreuil began to feel
reassured touching the danger that had once
seemed threatening, of her daughter becoming
like unto an Englishwoman, and fast. Poor
Claire! there was nothing fast about her noAv,
nothing at all resembling one of those fabulous
British dames, rampant and noisy, horsey and
self-indulgent, which haunt the dreams of
proper French mothers in this dreadfully
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 293 -->
cosmopolitan age. Claire was quieter than
formerly: subdued even, rather than calm,
and gentle exceedingly. Her voice, her look,
her step, all were softer, slower; in short, as I
said, subdued; and, just as, some weeks before,
there had been a rising and swelling of the
current of life Avithin her, so now its ebb-tide
had come, and her joy and pride of living was
reduced.


Claire had never been so lovely in the eyes
of those who, when appreciating a woman's
beauty, take into account her immaterial part.
Olivier thought she was a little gone off, and
not nearly so attractive as before; he supposed
the perpetual gaieties of the province tired her.
But, after all, it was no business of his.


Aunt Clementine thought she was like
nothing so much as the beautiful blush rose
she had worn in her hair on the night of the
great ball; but she said nothing, only she
was anxiously tender to her niece.


Victor lived amongst people for whom the
young Marquise was a perpetual object of
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 294 -->
interest; no day AA-ent by without his
havingheard her praised, Avithout his having been
himself obliged to devote to her, present or
absent, a considerable portion of his attention
—perhaps even more when absent than when
present, for Olivier's fair Avife was a theme for
unceasing speculation. " Was she happy ? "
there soon came to be the great question. It
concerned none of those Avho asked it, but it
busied them none the less for that. That she
was virtuous all kneAV—pure, spotless as the
snow on untrodden heights—but was she
condemned to an eternally unloving life ? Where
truth is, give but a small lapse of time, and it
will appear; it Avas soon an admitted fact that
the young Marquise did not love her husband.
Hoav was this discovered ? none could say. It
simply was so, and that it was so grew to be
knoAvn. Was she blamed ? No ! And Olivier ?
no more than she. It was a very common
case, and as no one adverted to the fact that
it was attributable to the institution of marriage
upon the limited liability system—marriage
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 295 -->
without love—no one did aught save speculate
upon what were to be Claire's compensations
in life.


Was she to be one of those Avives—so
common in France—Avhose austere fives are
built upon the renouncement of every joy;
and who too often entafl upon the chddren, to
whom they sacrifice everything, the gloom of
an entire existence void of love ?


If so, it would be a pity. Claire was too
beautiful for that; too womanly! That
impressed all men.


\"She is so womanly! " Avould they say, " so
irresistible in her sweet, wifely beauty !" and
then they pitied and poetised her, and came to
speak of her in a way that was unfamiliar
to Victor. And he, too, grew to pity her,
and to think of her as he had never been
wont to do, and yet was totally unsuspicious
of any danger.


Claire's conduct on the one hand was so
perfect in her every deed, thought, word, or
look, breathed such all but holy purity—and,
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 296 -->
on the other hand, Olivier Avas so inferior to
her in every sense, that M. de Lancour soon
ceased to admonish his cousin upon the duty
of loving her husband. He had not the heart
to do it, but with this change in his bearing
towards her came another. He allowed
himself to think of her as unhappy, and he
unconsciously greAv to suffer with his cousin Claire.


There might be danger at hand, but neither
diAined it. Claire was schooling herself to
resignation, to the task of giving up all life's
gladsome brightness—all the consolation even
of thinking that, had circumstances been
different, Victor Avould have asked her for his
wife—for had he not said he thought ill of
marriages between cousins ? Claire was trying
to obliterate even the innocent sweet dreams
of the past; and Victor Avas grieved—and for
ever busy Avith his grief—that she Avhom he
loved so tenderly should be doomed to lead a
life so dull, so colourless, and so stale.  
  
  
  That was all. And so the days wore on.  
  
  
  In the very beginning of October there Avas
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 297 -->
to be an agricultural meeting at Combeville.
Brunoy and Malleray had had each their fete,
and the last distribution of prizes was to take
place at Combeville. It Avas to be rather a
solemn affair, for this part of the province,
lying nearer towards La Beauce, was the most
purely agricultural district of all, and laid
claims to respect, in the wray of mangel Avurzel,
cart-horses, and pigs. There had been, on the
side of the great proprietors, several successful
attempts at improAing the equine race, and
{empty}M. de Clavreufi and Henri Dupont had both,
upon one occasion, sent up to Paris, to a cattle
show, a team or two of regenerated Percherons
that won the suffrages of all connoisseurs.
There were some adventurous spirits wiio had
tried sheep; but, as a general rule, mutton was
said not to pay, and. horses and pigs remained
in the ascendant—the former really justifying
this perseArerance, the latter decidedly bad, but
filling the souls of their breeders with
satisfaction. They delighted in their long-legged,
large-eared, flabby-flanked pigs. Horned cattle
<!-- Leaf 308, Page: 298 -->
came mostly from the opposite extremity of the
department, and several prized animals Avere
sent from Malleray and Brunoy to grace the
fete held in honour of the people of Combeville.
In a large field preceding the entrance to the
toAvn, booths and stalls were erected as for a
fair; and, to say the truth, there Avas, in fact,
a fair as well as an agricultural show, and all
the savages, and Avild beasts, and learned dogs,
and strolling players for fifty miles round had
assembled there, in order to convert the
toAvnsfolk of Combeville into their especial
ratepayers.


The weather being splendid, and the
department unusually full of visitors, it was
foretold that the concours regional, as it was
termed, Avould be more than usually brilliant.


It was early in the day when tAvo or three
carriages, filled Avith the guests staying at the
chateau, left Cla-vreuil. M. de Lancour Avas
not of the number; he, and in general the
inhabitants of Tours, profited by a part of
the raihvay, and went direct. The Clavreuil
<!-- Leaf 309, Page: 299 -->
party were, besides the Count and Countess
and Claire and Madame Beaudouin, a family
of cousins from the south, and five or six stray
men, sportsmen whose mission it was to kill
other men's game, and who did so to their
heart's content.


Claire did the honours of her caleche to her
Languedocian cousins, husband and AAife, and
gaA^e the fourth place to an ex-chef d'escadron
of cuirassiers, who had retired from service on
account of his numerous wounds, and lived
universally respected in the neighbourhood.
The conversation happening to fall upon M. de
Lancour, the commandant became
irrepressible—it was a favourite theme—and launched
forth, for the benefit of the dark-eyed southern
lady opposite to him, into recitals of the
deeds of valour he had seen Victor perform
in the Italian campaign of 1859. He could
not conceive how he escaped with life from
Magenta, where he received the cross upon the
battle-field; and as to Solferino, why he
believed him to havTe withstood single-handed
<!-- Leaf 310, Page: 300 -->
the attack of a whole troop of Jagers! To
be sure he was so severely Avounded there that
no one in the army believed he could ever

recover.


Such things, opined the commandant, Avhen
you happened to Avitness them, did make you
curious about a man's destiny. The
commandant Avas a bit of a philosopher.


\"I often wonder," he said, " what Lancour's
eventual fate will be; Avhen you see a man
saved from such all but inevitable destruction
you can't help thinking he's saved for some
purpose—but what ?"


And Claire listened to it all in silence, and
dreamily wondered, too, Avithin herself, for
what fate, sad or glorious, her cousin Victor
Avas saved.


They reached the ground and alighted, and,
dividing into groups of threes and fours,
proceeded to visit the various booths and stalls,
and agreed to make a general trysting-place of
a knoll at one end of the field, Avhereon the
Due de Vivienne had established a large tent
<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 301 -->
Avith a magnificent luncheon, and whence it
was perfectly possible to see the races, which
were the chief attraction of all.


Claire, Avith her usual kindness, gave herself
up to the task of amusing her southern relative,
to whom all about him was strange. She took
him from stall to stall, above all among the
vegetables, shoAving him pumpkins as big as
Memnon's head, carrots and beet-roots of the
size of a giant's thigh, monstrous melons, and
peaches OA7ergrown; (" All Avater and no sun !"
as he observed contemptuously, reverting to the
small, saAroury, heat-cracked fruit of his OAvn
baking south.)


Then she took him to see the Percherons,
and the pigs, and the live-stock generally, and
Avhen she had done her duty thoroughly, and
shoAvn him nearly everything, she found she
was separated from all her party, and on the
AATong side of the field.


This was called so by the people of Claire's
set, simply because it was appropriated to the
sio-htseers of the official world. The Mayor
<!-- Leaf 312, Page: 302 -->
and municipality of Combeville had erected a
grand stand, whence a comprehensive view
was obtained of the whole field beneath; and
into the central compartment of this stand
Avere to be introduced all the high officials of
the county. There Avere three compartments,
one in the centre, Avhich projected beyond the
other two, and two Avings. The central seats
Avere evidently the grand ones, for they were
covered Avith red velvet, and upon all the
hangings of this part of the edifice there were
gold fringes and tassels. Here Avere to be
seated the prefect, and the sub-prefects, and
the Mayor, and the general and municipal
councillors, and all the local grandees, and
their families.


In the two side tribunes there Avas a trifle
less splendour; no gold at all, and hangings of
red stuff instead of velvet. The chairs, too,
and benches, were hard, and straAv or
canebottomed. These tribunes were for the public.


While the young Marquise Avas reconnoitring
her position, and the possibilities of regaining
<!-- Leaf 313, Page: 303 -->
the Mont-Vivienne tent, the sub-prefect of
Brunoy came up to her, and, volunteering his
services, besought her to take refuge in the
official stand, close to which she was then
standing. He offered her a front seat, worthy
man! and suggested, not Avithout some
timidity, how charmed Madame the Prefectess
Avould be to extend to her the hospitality of
the tribune.


Claire was embarrassed, for she recoiled
from hurting any one, and yet she felt that
her father would never tolerate her being the
guest of the chief government authority of the
place. Her Languedocian cousin, so far from
helping her, voted noisily for acceptance of
the well-meant offer.


Was there no means of crossing the field ?
None ? The crowd was immense, the
gendarmes had begun to clear the course, and
from the to-wn side the dust of a long string of
carriages was perceived.


\"There is Monsieur the Prefect!" exclaimed
the Brunoy functionary; "you have not a
<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 304 -->
moment to lose, Madame la Marquise, or you
Avill be crushed by the crowd; let me entreat
of you to accept my arm—pray allow me "


But Claire had bethought her of a
compromise : she could not avoid placing herself
in the official stand, but she Avould do so
quietly, and preserving as it Avere a kind of
incognito. In spite, therefore, of all the
endeavours of the sub-prefect, and all the
murmurs of the Languedocian relative, she
achieved what she desired, namely, a seat on
the second row of the benches in the left hand
Aving of the stand. There she felt herself very
comfortably situated, and thanked the
subprefect of Brunoy for his attention, as he took
his leaAre to go and fill his more exalted
position in the velvet draperied centre.


The tribune Avas unusually high, and the
seats, when reached, placed you upon the level
of any lofty first-floor in a Paris house. The
stairs by Avhich you attained to them Avere
roughly put together, and denoted haste. A
feAv moments after Claire had taken her seat
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 305 -->
the rush into the tribune began. The
authorities were to have enjoyed precedence of
everyone, but not all the efforts or loud
threats of the gendarmes could obtain this;
and prefect and prefectess, and all the
uniformed male dignitaries, and all the
overdressed female ones, tumbled in pell mell with
their less mighty fellow creatures. The throng
of people was tremendous, and you might feel
the boards vibrate and tremble under you,
as billow after billow of the crowd came
surging up.


As many ladies came into the part of the
stand where Claire sat, she induced her
companion to make way for them by retreating
to the back seats, nearer to the door. He did
not like this at first, but he obeyed, and was
apparently very soon rewarded for it by the
pleasures of an animated conversation with
his neighbours, to whom Claire heard him
loudly imparting his satisfaction at being so
high up.  
  
  
  " You have a thousand times better view  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  X
<!-- Leaf 316, Page: 306 -->
than from that tent of theirs yonder!" he
declared unceremoniously.


The neighbour, however, shook his head,
and said they had built the stand a great deal
too high.


The young Marquise looked round, and here
and there caught sight of a familiar face, and
exchanged greetings Avith an acquaintance.


From the left Aving, where she Avas sitting,
you could see across, betAveen the poles which
supported the festoons over the prefect's seats,
into the right wing.


There, there Avere many strangers, a feAV of
the younger officers of M. de Lancour's
regiment, and several Englishmen; and then a
face caught her eye, and her heart beat. It
was a face she had not seen for many months,

—not seen since Good Friday, and as she
gazed upon it (and she could not help gazing!)
the dirge of the Stabat Mater seemed to ring
again through her brain.


She could not detach her gaze, I repeat.
Berthe de Mottefort, it seemed to her, had not
<!-- Leaf 317, Page: 307 -->
improved since the day she saw her last. She
Avas not better looking; but she looked more
anxious. She was, as ever, excellently
welldressed, with that air of severe grace, and that
attention to severe colouring, that become her
Avho has only external propriety left her to
observe.


Claire now felt she must cease to look, for
an instinct told her that if she looked longer,
her gaze would be answered, and she would
not meet Berthe's eye. She averted her glance,
sent it wandering over nearer objects, and all
at once encountered Victor's.


{empty}M. de Lancour was standing at the back of
the central tribune, a whole deep range of
seats behind the prefect's arm-chair.


Claire's eye rested on Victor's, and both so
instantaneously and so thoroughly felt what
was passing in each other's mind, that neither
bowed nor made any attempt at bowing; they
looked for one second straight into each other's
soul, and then Victor, with a" pained
expression, looked down; Claire, blushing scarlet,  
  
  
  x 2
<!-- Leaf 318, Page: 308 -->
looked away. M. de Lancour felt that Claire
had judged Berthe, and Claire felt that Victor
knew she had done so.


A signal was given, and the prefect rose to
make a speech; but the tribune was far too
high, no one heard him. Then other speeches
folloAved, and then music from bands stationed
beneath; then a list of names was read, the
names of those Avho had got prizes, and in
these various ceremonies a period of two hours
went by.


And still the crowd mounted, and set
gendarmes at nought, and thronged the
illmade stairs, and pushed and pressed to gain
admittance.


All at once, there Avas a pause, and then a
bell rang. At last! there Avere the races, and
that was folloAved by one of those mysterious
movements that are peculiar to thick throngs.


The human sea heaved as with a ground
swell, breathed as from one chest, as the sea
does; was, as it were, all one, and rolled,
cumbrously disportive, in its contentment.
<!-- Leaf 319, Page: 309 -->

The movement was accompanied by an
odd cracking sound. Very slight. Then
the bell rang for starting :—then !—what was
that?


Was it a cry ? a roar ? a crash ? all that;
yet nothing 0f that—other than that : a dim
sense of something horrible; a Aision, a
nightmare, a convulsion; perhaps, who knows, an
earthquake ?


There Avas a jar, a Avrench, a break, and
crackings, and upliftings, and splittings, as in
a rock-struck ship; a wild din of mingled
voices; a wfld jostle of human bodies jumbled
together in heaps; a pavement of upturned
faces, ghastly with dread; a giddy whirl, as
of the fall from a balloon—chaotic confusion,
so that men knew not whether all around
them reeled, or whether their own brain was

reefing.


The great stand had given way, and some
two or three hundred people were being hurled,
from a height of four or five-and-twenty feet,
to the ground.
<!-- Leaf 320, Page: 310 -->

Some threw themselves deliriously down
from the front seats, and were maimed, killed,
or caught by the crowd beloAV; some clutched
at their neighbours, some clung to poles or
planks for support. The worst accidents
happened at the back of the tribune, for
the many had throAvn themselves with one
rush towards the staircase Avhich had first

given way.


Claire had risen to her feet instinctively
Avith the rest, upon the first alarm; but
Avithout understanding what was passing.
When she understood, one feeling
predominated in her over all, and she looked at
Victor.


He had no thought for her, at that hour, or
for any special one; he had thought only for
all, and for his duty in trying to be of use to
all. He had so placed himself as to keep
momentarily an issue free at the back of the
central compartment of the tribune; for,
poised upon some not yet fallen Avoodwork,
and with his right arm holding firm to a pole
<!-- Leaf 321, Page: 311 -->
that had withstood the shock, M. de Lancour
bore upon his shoulders and the back of his
head and neck, the whole weight of the lower
portion of the roofing, which he thus prevented
from crushing the struggling people who were
Avrithing and shrieking round him. This could
only endure a few minutes, for the rest of the
fabric was tottering; and every nafi that
loosened itself brought perdition. Behind him
was space.


Claire looked at Victor, not merely fearless,
but inspired Avith one grand, sweet purpose.
A man may be lion-hearted and yet quail
before such a scene as this : how much more
then a woman ! But one loving thought
mastered Claire now, and raised her above the
consciousness of danger.  
  
  
  She might die with him !  
  
  
  That it wTas inspired her.


And then, as it is related of droAvning men
that they see even into the minutest incident of
their fives in one brief second, Claire suddenly
saw her empty, lonely past peopled with
<!-- Leaf 322, Page: 312 -->
shadows only, and where burned but one light
—her hopeless love.


A violent scream, folloAved by sharp, angry
cries, and repeated shrieks of " Victor ! Victor!"
sounded, as it seemed, close to her ear, and she
blushed in her inmost soul for the cowardly
heart that could not meet death proudly, dying
by his side. How much better she, Claire,
loved him than did this woman !


No one in the terror-stricken crowd heeded
these screams, or heard them. Claire heard
them, and saAV Berthe de Mottefort's
panicmarked face as she struggled in the midst of
the falling throng.


The scaffolding of the left-hand Aving, where
Claire had been seated, had not yet given
way; so that, by leaning against the pole in
the corner of that compartment, she might
still maintain her and give time
for some contrivance from beloAV to save
her.


But Claire's thoughts were not fixed on
safety; they were all for him whom she had
<!-- Leaf 323, Page: 313 -->
loved—she never knew how much till the near
approaching infinite of death taught her her
own kindred infinite of love.


It came back upon her, now, what the
commandant had said; and she saw Victor
glorycrowned at Magenta and bleeding at Solferino.
Saved ! Saved for what ? Why for this, to be
sure—for her!


Judge her not, mothers of children, whose
fathers have been your first love.


She thought not then of her baby, smiling
rosily, in her own girlhood's home—she thought
of the imagined happiness that had been
denied her.


It was not love that beckoned her on, but
love in death. The strong holy purity of a
death-marked love.


Victor did not love her; would, living, never
love her. His love was for the craven-hearted
woman who, in her greed of life, cast his name
ignobly to the crowd; his love was for her
wdio was unworthy of him. But death was so
solemn, so sanctifying, that in the hour of
<!-- Leaf 324, Page: 314 -->
parting Avith life, he might know how he had
been loved.


All this Avhiii of conflicting thoughts tore,
Avhirh\ind-like, through Claire's brain in a feAV
short seconds.


Victor was still at his perilous post, warding
off destruction, for an instant, from the poor
agonized creatures that sought to escape; but
boards cracked, planks yielded, and the roof
Avas crushing him more and more. His footing
too was unstable, and must give way. There
Avere cries for ropes and ladders from beneath,
but no one seized their purport. And where
Avere ladders; or where were ropes ?


There Avas no hope. Whoever might be
saved, Victor would be crushed to death
inevitably.


Inevitable ? yes. There lay the sanction—
death : therein lay the charm, the hope, the
certainty of union.


The Moment, divine in its impalpable,
invincible power—the Moment which prompted
Antony's immortal shame at Actium, and has
<!-- Leaf 325, Page: 315 -->
inspired all acts of unlimited devotion—the
Moment sent its resistless revelation to Claire's
heart, and her resolve Avas taken.


How she over-stepped that space, she kneA\r
not; there were masses of rubbish heaped up
between Victor and herself: boards, benches,
rent draperies, torn dresses, and, in one place,
a large yaAvning space, through winch it Avas
difficult not to fall. But she neither fell nor
stumbled; it almost seemed to herself as though
she had wings and flew.


Just as a fresh sound of demolition Avas
heard, and a loud cry of wail and horror rose
up from below, Claire, all obstacles over-stepped,
reached the same unsteady footing upon which
Victor was maintaining himself, and, flushed
with her oavu ardent purpose, forgetful of all
save her one aim, reached her cousin's side,
and with her hand seizing his, breathed softly
only the words,—  
  
  
  " Here I am."  
  
  
  It was too late.  
  
  
  With one tremendous crash, the remainder
<!-- Leaf 326, Page: 316 -->
  
  of what had been the grand stand fell in, and,
for several minutes, only a thick cloud of dust
Avas visible.
